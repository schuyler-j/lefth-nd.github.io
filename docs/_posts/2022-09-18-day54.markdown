hmm no posts in over 2 weeks. i guess i was busy. the site is coming along decently. i spent a couple of days setting up the aws side of things. god damn. so many features. i've got the db on an ec2 instance and i can connect but only through my public ip. not so good for the others. still exploring solutions. aws offers vpn services and what not but i was lost down a rabbit hole of CA's and identity managers... eh. in other news. a few assignments were released. SS report and NN report. NN seems fine and experimentation can resume tomorrow (i need a break from web dev). however. the SS report is, in standard flunders form, complete nonsense. a consultancy report about migrating to windows and linux from what? you guessed it. windows and linux. in one element we must discuss increasing security by making changes to the local password settings? but this is an enteprise scenario. why on earth would a local user be making local changes to their password settings in a corporate context? we're migrating to windows and no mention of active directory? and we're supposed to develop screenshot aided help-desk walkthroughs for the user? like i said. complete nonsense. sometimes i stare at my monitor, with the cursor of my terminal blinking at me, and the faint hum of my pc fan in the air, wondering, daydreaming...
