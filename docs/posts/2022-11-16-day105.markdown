hi. long time no blog. semester finished. year complete. kinda.  
ctf late october was fun. found more flags than i thought i would.  
PS wasn't as bad as its reputation. SS was, hmm... a complete waste of time? eh. it was okay.  
the WS project turned out pretty neat. a lot of dumb mistakes but we landed.  
NN was decent but the structure needs some work.  
it becomes increasingly clear that in terms of 'career-ready' assetts are left entirely within the hands of the student.  
but that's half the fun...  
as for the summer, ykw fell through, so we're looking at more full stack, more stable-diffusion and discord stuff?
fast times, fast times indeed...
