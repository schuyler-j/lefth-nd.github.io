Does God Cook Fish?

Death, Dreams and Feedback Loops

Shepherd's Pie Give 'Em Gab

The Way Back When Before the Big Air

J. B. Schuyler

Chapter 1

Formidable Philosophical Formulations

Eureka!

A Found Big Confusion...

Lost!

Under the blanket stars of the Milky Way...

Born!

Once upon a great while, a sky so entirely Blue...

Engineered!

A glow of passion lost its spark...

Reborn!

And this is the perfect place for a beginning, wouldn't you say? In blinding light. We begin confused, we exist confused and we die confused. Are you confused? Get used to it. Make confusion our greatest friend, shall we? We shall! Cry, cry cry, big baby, have some more please? In fact we might as well, otherwise the thorn of confusion will grow into a big beast of absurdity; then we'll be stuck with our faces in the sands of infinity. To think of it, we might just become so infatuated with our home of confusion, that we'll gladly embrace the loving arms of that very self-same absurdity we sought to avoid and feel oh so safe in doing ourselves in for a forever nap. What, thought, is 'Confusion'? Some may know that, the state of being confused produces great curiosity, sew sum an 'ole, you are such a mirror with all your projected reflections; you will come to know this, just as they have known it all this time. With great curiosity, comes great luminosity, the lighting of the candlewick way is bright and inviting, you know. It is inevitably leading us to a temporary clarity, in the daylight of all things and with a little persistence by the wayside, we'll have plenty of said confused clarity. Clearly confused! Ah, yes, dear reader, confusion, there it is again, let's put forth a question that will be a friend to us and our confusion, let it laugh along in us, humming to one form or another throughout these riddled chapters, line to line, ear to ear, face to face! Yes, cast another kind of line out into the sea of the unknown, the deep dark blue. To wonder at the simple calm of it all stare at the precious void, simply face it with anxious curiosity. 'Wake with an open mind and sleep on a rested soul!', someone surely said. In other words, don't freak out and storm off when the question confuses your data capacities, just tap into that curious creative spirit and press on with humility and daring openness. It's a curious anxiety that will shepherd our bait in the water as it bobs against the will of whims. Here's our question, our proverbial bobber if you will, 'Does.
God-
cook... fish?' I've always wondered this peculiar dribble of a query. What would a God possibly need a fish for? Does a God eat? Surely, a God can do anything a God wants to do, they're God. So, what does a god want to do? Would a god want to eat a fish? For what reason? Are there any other uses for a fish? What are fish for? Does wanting and needing presuppose a required usefulness to a certain item? To a human a fish may be a sport, a dish, or maybe even a companion. Say a God did want to eat a fish, would a god need to cook said fish? Or would it already be cooked and ready to eat? Why go through the process of cooking and eating when the pleasure and sensation of eating, the feeling of it, is what is most desired? Why not just take that pleasure and give it to yourself, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in every which way? After all, a god can do anything and everything they want to, no? And what of the fish? Does the god give the fish awareness of its swimming and of its being caught and eaten? Would the god suppress this from the fish so that the god can sleep freely of a guilty conscience? Does a god have the need for a conscience? Why not subdue and supress all these unnecessary extremities and just simply focus on the pleasure at play? In fact, why have anything bad happen at all, why not just have good fun all the time? Good feelings, good answers to every damn question, no trouble, no worries at all ever! Would an entity such as that, a thing with everything at their fingertips, a thing of such completeness, ever wish for anything at all? Would an entity like that even need such familiar corners and walls like perseverance, obstacle, triumph, struggle, adversity, flaw? Would an entity like that even experience anything at all? If they had everything right at their disposal, every whim taken care of for and by themselves, would they then have the urge to invent a situation like the one you sense before your own senses with the one thing they lack, a game of limits and bounds to occupy their dull lonely perfection? Purely out of the fact that to be limitless is in fact the greatest limitation of all. For to exist without struggle is to simply not exist at all. The most boredom you could ever imagine, that's a God's life. To actually want something you need to not currently have it, you need limitations for to have purpose. This gives rise to a struggle, a something to overcome. So what struggle shall we wish for, to spruce up the doldrum? To what intensity/height would you set the bar at? Too high, too hard - too low, too easy, where's the balance, hmm? You are now a god, imagine it, in your universe how much good will you pluck and how much evil will you paint? How much pain will you give and how much pleasure will you take? In your game of limits and bounds, how flawed shall the flawed be? You are now a god, imagine it. What features will you have, what bugs and corruptions will you design for your creation? Will you fashion yourself selfishly into perfection in your new world? Or will you sit back and watch your creation? The perfect life for your inhabitants to mirror your own? But what is perfect? The dream home, the dream spouse, the dream career. A pool the size of an ocean, a garage as big as a neighbourhood! Wait, what are all those things? We haven't even arrived at galactic planetary systems, where is nitrogen? Oxygen? And yet you're in the halls of vanity already? Well, it's not your fault really, these words put you there, they can put you wherever they want. The ideal body, the most desirable bone structure, legs for days, hips for weeks! Abs, pecks, quads and biceps, exceptional obliques, oh yes! Chiselled jaws, flawless skin, zygomatic sculpted perfection... But that's just the physical, the material, the phenotypical tip of the iceberg. What about life experiences? What perfect path shall you carve out for yourself? You are now a god, imagine it. Will you give all your wanderers perfect lives? Remember now, barriers bother you, we can have none of those upsetter's. Will you weave your populous into smaller versions of you, like little tiny mirrors? Leaving them without burden? So no trouble shall befall them? No bossy hard feelings? Where's the fun in that? Where's your sense of adventure? Being a god sounds like far too much responsibility to handle. As a mortal human, (this, I'm assuming you are one) you trade-in the access of a fantasy land with everything, for the cold-hard reality of promising potential. A potent reality with sauce and spice in the shadow's unknown, thoroughly steeped in possibility. If potential was fully knowable/provable/foreseeable it wouldn't be potential, it'd just be reality, a severely boring one at that. They say a soul dies the moment its destiny is reflected before him. You don't get to know your potential, the same way you don't really know if someone loves you, you've just got to believe it. It's not something you theorise and prove with dissertations and analytical dissection, discussions, dialectics, sew on's and snow fourths. You take a leap of faith, you put your heart in the hurt of hope. And you beg of the question, 'Does God cook fish?' Thus revealing itself to be a question of potential! Look at that word again, question. Your limitations set the boundaries to your potential reality, the adventure in the face of it is what life is all about, it is a quest we shall embark upon.

Well, now to put a temporary answer to our big question, we can say, "No, God doesn't perform the cooking of fish as God has no need for cooking or of the consuming of fish", and what a sad state of affairs that must be. Now you're a God, imagine it. Let's make a universe! We shall start with an empty space, let's fill it with some time to get us ready for our movements, we'll have, past - present - future. Now for some things that can move, impregnate it with matter so everything can matter. With our matter let's have some meaning, moving things that can move from the unknown into the known to give us on things and off things, our matter must be finite. Make this matter grey so it can do some thinking. Forces that oppose each other, up and down, chaos and order, black-white-yin-yang, we'll need all those for a balance of blend. Now with that space and time we'll have ourselves some knowledge, now we'll have history. Our duality is looking pretty snazzy already! We'll also need some purple, to keep things exciting, an observer to witness it all. A galaxy to put all our stars in. A solar system to keep our colours organised. Now for some greens and blues and yellows too. All for one of the planets to get some life on it going. Keep it simple, start with single cells. Shove it all in the tiniest box imaginable, add a couple dice, shake it up and hit, umm, play and watch the green grow.

We're using our vegetables as a crutch, our greenery, our aesthetic. No matter how many times we run the experiment, we get the same result. What is this obsession with manifesting a dystopia? These little boxes, tiny boxed houses, these are not homes, they are cubicles of confusion. They're absolutely transfixed with boxing everything up. No one sees in and no one can see out. A tribe of Oompa Loompas with the bright idea of overthrowing their Wonka overlord have just arrived, let's take a closer look. They've received word of a new-fangled technology designed to manifest their very own "perfect world". No more bowing down to the big ole' chocolate bar tyranny. The Loompas are on their way to choke their Willy and travel to the great new lands of hope and wonder and dreams! No more chocolate, no more work, no more drear, the sky's the limit my Limp Loompa Lamps. Maybe then they won't be so misanthropic and contrived, maybe then they won't be so damn human. Or maybe it'll all backfire...

Beginning the game of 'Sally Says'... I found you lying there, down in a slump, feeling so sorry for yourself. I decided to show you around this hotel. Have you ever played 'Sally Says' before?

N.V.R.M

The Beginning is now a new beginning to have begun.

Way back when the universe was always on, which was all a play of nonsense, no sense. Every moment was always existing? Time was a what then? Time is a relative, no? A relative of whom? Who be the God of time, if not space? Him that beckons, Hers in reflection of time that giveth space, time give us space. Like chicken giveth egg. To fry. And make big breakfast with. Space and time in holy matrimony, a breakfast of universal proportion.

Let me tell you the rules of the game. I want to nip this in the bud, bud. So listen close and listen careful. Plenty of people have come and gone with a heck of a lot of talk to say and you can be so damn sure that they've made mad tricks up their squawk sleeves. You see, this place isn't for someone like you, you've only been here, what, a few paragraphs? That's not nearly enough dice to get you started out of harm's way, the Landlord is coming, and he wants the rent. Listen bud, smooth talking Sally's are a dime a dozen 'round these parts; you've got to keep your wits razor wicked or some coke dealing sham shilling dopey smack-smokin' con artist is gon' do ya in, righto chief? Now, me you can trust, ah ha, but down these kooky hall slits and dimly lit passage which-ways and what-have-you's, everything starts to look the same. There's only one rule when it comes to 'Sally Says', more of a guideline really, "never trust the narrator". You never know who's telling you what, when the only thing you got is squiggly lines and sardonic symbolisms. Sardines and superstition won't get ya far mate, Sally says, keep an open mind.

So, since words can't be trusted (lovely as they are), we're going to have to develop a system, otherwise you're going to get lost. You're going to get lost anyway but a system will soften the blow. Many travellers navigate these wally walls and you'll meet many. It doesn't matter who tells you what, as long as you promise to keep your head on secure enough to hang on to but not so secure that your neck gets sore. We might not hear from us again; whatever happens, happens, all that matters is th-

Light a candle, have fun! Seriously, light a candle, or at least play a video of a candle.

If you watch a flame flicker, you'll notice the flame flickers faster and faster until it is 'always on'. For a moment or two, then it flickers again, flicker-flicker. Our universe has the same repetition-ness, in and out of existence, on and off, in and out; when you fuck, what do you do? The movement is a back and forth, the duality of states ping pongs from connection to disconnection, day to night, up, down, left and on to right. The revolution is continuous, the journey is a circular cycle. Are you sure you haven't taken anything? The universe is always on! This infinity can be contacted through some kind of collective, this contact connectedness forms the basis of religious communal, it provokes deep patterns. Religious behaviours entail the worshipping of so-called deities. Creators of creations, the sources of their ketchup infinities, red with blood, ham over fist from overuse.

Sally says,

You're a lazy dog, mate.
If a society has nothing to worship, the will to idolisation kind of defers to the individual (the acting out of worship turns inwards). You pretty much just end up lovingly obsessed with yourself. In love with the mirror. Narcissism was in full flight raining cats and dogs; when our society was in its final decay. The more powerful we became the more worthy we felt of said worship. Sticks and stones are nothing to fight over, but a Gulfstream Jet and your own private island? You put the power of a demigod on the table and you'll have your war. It's a deep-seated insecurity being as self-conscious as a human, like animals at the masquerade ball with human suits on, nobody wants to be caught out and that feeling never goes away. Look at how they travel in trains, theres the rhinoceros reading newspapers, dolphins flipping through magazines. See that glassy-eyed giraffe over there, face glued to a phone? Oh look, a not so happy hippo wrestling with unruly children, neat. How does one reconcile the innate animalistic forces rummaging around one's psyche, giggling in the shadows so obviously hiding like a kid under a blanket? Repression, I suppose. Such fierce catastrophes this blind faith ego mood leads to, such ugly alleyways we've forced our hearts to hold. Strife will get you double; you'll hunt and burn for the warmth of that open fire. The ugly man wishes for his tribe, exclusivity even in the squalor of his depraved obsession. Tribe within tribe he'll create, to increase his complexity and run from his dirtiness. Anything to recreate the safe attitude of the womb, to escape eternal ridicule. Anything to reassure him of himself and the she's and hers that laugh in blank faces. In his grand weakness he is alone in recreation. She on the other hand is completely self-assured. But nobody has seen them for years. They used to make music together, now they just run through faraway corridors.

The static of a TV dances wildly in the dimly lit hotel room as an old radio retort...

There's No Such Thing as Bad Publicity

*
*Hooks give rise to the release of dopamine. And this is what the feed is all about. It only works if it has the capacity to shift moods. That's the ultimate force, mood shifter...

Is your life filled with useless junk? Do you wake up surrounded by trash every morning? You probably have a defective bullshit detector. No worries, there's an easy solution, and it won't cost an arm and a leg. Just pop on down to your local bullshit advisory retailer and get your dumb ass an upgrade! Do it now!! We recommend the Bullshito 4000, it comes with an automatic waste disposal unit for all those stubborn bullshitty stains. Do not delay! Rid yourself of bullshit today!

You cannot touch a reflection. A reflection is experienced at a distance. Mirror mirror...

So, what invented celebration shall we invent for ourselves today? What is worthy of worship?

The TV switches off and Sally slinks back into the shadows.

Halls begone of engineered belief, my reason takes no home.

Let's Begin

What are words? What is a definition? Is it okay to be excluded? To lose, is to be excluded from victory by definition, we must all lose sometimes. Definitions by definition are exclusive. There is that which is within and that which is without. A line separating the included from the excluded. Humans love creating worlds of exclusion with little words to communicate exclusivity. Tribes, families, homes, cultures, borders, land, shopping centres, memes, inside jokes. If the game is fair, we shall play, what's fair? Definitions, they fragment continually.

As an aside, let me say, will you think of me not as the dictator of these words but merely as the mirror that reflects them. I am an actor, this is audition. We are all equal as we look towards the source that is separate from me, we are together in our lookingness. I, as much as you, walk shrouded in bewilderment. I take no credit for what I am just simply a witness to. We are the observer, nothing more, nothing less. Let's explore together, hand in hand. Agreed?

Fair is an equal chance of failure, no? But we humans are far from equal in ability, so much variation, so many different avenues. Humans are like the summation of every single living thing; we can see ourselves in everything. Lion against mouse, fair fight? What the lion has, the mouse does not and vice versa, what the mouse has the lion does not. When something wins it gains the perspective of a winner and loses the perspective of a loser. Thus the universe is in perfect balance, to the fool's egoic everlasting dismay.

The universe is a redundant array reflecting its reflection of redundancy in fierce geometric perfection. Our subjective experience of that geometry is pure terror; it's the spirit of the unknown, the alien database in the world of planes and coordinates, the hotel of lost dreams, the Landlord's Lair, 'Droldnal'. Some worship his way, some think him to be a madman.

When the cube goes in the square hole, chemicals flow. 'Good Job', says the brain. The pendulum swings into order as all the other pendulums harmonise across the horizon line. Most of the time it doesn't, so most of the time they whinge about all the messy dissonance in their hotel heads. When 'is son is absent, there is dance for all. For the vertical line we make use of the yoyo, the up and down. This intersectional pendulum-yoyo dynamic produces our merry-go-round, this is the heart of a hotel, this is the locus of our adventure. We can create anything within these moving walls.

The possibility of potential adventurous avenues is endlessly endless in its Infinity of dead dying dreams locked away in these halls. Like the pages of a book unopened, folded and squashed together. These pages that represent floors of a hotel weave tiny knots of new stuff. Kept inside are the lost dreams, dead dreams, the happy, the sad and the unbelievably nightmarish. We simply must explore is all! First, we must find Myra, my son.

The Beginning is Now

For one to create one must be far enough towards the camp of 'alien perspective' in order to see what is new (way out there in the nether). Yet not so far as to displace the human experience entirely. A true alien would indeed create fantastically wonderful objects and artefacts however, they wouldn't be religiously compelling as it would be devoid of the human condition, except for those parts of the condition that crossover into the universal condition of life living in itself. Likewise, a perfectly regular human would also create sub-par works as they would not be alien enough to see outside the human experience and detect that which is new in the nether. Great art from the alien heart. The human extra-terrestrial. Are you ready to meet our first guest?

The beginning is now ending to be a beginning again, again. Before we move on, we must clear the air; get to know each other with some philosophical preamble. Sweet as pie... Now we'll hear from a soul wanderer by the name of Gonza. A time travelling, mystical-majestical Ganja smoking gazelle from some forgotten land, a damn good dreamer. Gonza saved the Hospillian Telmadri from the old-world tyrants. And my what-a-when their tongue can weave, find them weaving in the lobby with all the other tiny little long things.

It's the rebellious teen in the straitjacket of a mad scientist. He's on the loose, headed straight for nihilism, let's watch the play from a distance. Every idea with even a hint of pseudoscience will be demolished. The drear of the puddle, magnificent spawn. I'm going to sit here with my birdseed and mango, wrapped in a thick blanket of dreams with a hot chocolate and write for a while. Okay, so, where was I? Oh yes. It's a path straight to nihilism, reasoning with the naïve sword of the sceptic. Once it gets there, boom, it detonates. Causing a strange vacuum. Which way it contorts the adolescent mind depends on the individual's spirit. Creatives go in this bin; non-creatives go in this one. Creatives that haven't the gall of trauma to conjure anything new? They split in two, we call them schizophrenics. Ahh, gosh that's a good hot chocolate, really savouring the last mouthful, warms me all over. 'Astrology in the dirt. Religion? Pah! Fantasy for the weaklings and the dogmatically inclined.' The arrogance of the adolescent knows no bounds, spraying obscenities. But this is the way of the growing creative, the budding philosopher.

Now let's ham the charade, my brother. It's time to put the bean back in the sack. Can I just point out that you are a living human being in a singular body that has a finite amount of time on this special planet and this is the selfish way you've chosen to govern yourself here today, in this appalling matter, for all to see. Have we not grown past the point of these tides and taken good looks at the innards of our ugliness? Can we not simply appreciate the struggle of our existence together as family? We've all got to live here, man. The space you're taking up with your negativity is a serious etch in the sketch of my compartment. Some call it a brain, have you used one lately? Listen to the fists of the crowds in the clouds and understand that there's other more seriously pressing matters in the spoon soup slop being fed to you my alphabetically challenged antelope. We may come from different parts of the world, have alternate psychological make ups, speak different languages, arrive at opposite conclusions, act, think and dance differently. But can we not both agree that you and me, both breathe a substance none of us can see? And can we not agree that our ability to think differently, is our most valuable asset?

So don't stomp around like a Dorothy on stage, just grow up and act your bloody age. Empty heads will roll...

On the Spirit of Creation

I'm not one for bedtime stories, I prefer the freedom of a blank slate. Still, I have trouble falling asleep. Imagination only takes us so far, we need a longer while, a deeper sleep. Where do we go when we die, Myra? I always seem to forget...

Grab some things and sit down. Look at this painting. Marvellous. Creation is subjective folks, creative folk are cuckoo, bat crap crazy, goooone! In terms of subjectivity, they favour none but their own, this is the conviction that a creative must endure and what they may lack in observable courage is far outweighed by their unearthly trust in imagination, intuition, all things woo. This organisational engine of pattern, potential and possibility is unbridled; its will is commanding of both masculine and feminine spirit, two sides of the same coin, manifesting duality. This is the way a story is told, from A to B, a travelling of roller coasting ups and downs. When two people love each other very much, they smoosh themselves together a whole bunch to create life, to create an observer, the spirit of the child. A creation of creation.

This keeps the rules of reality real vague to the point of almost complete relativity. "Make your own meaning" Ha! Well good luck with it, you are a god no more, you've been kicked out, you have neither the fortitude nor the strength of a story tellers' tongue to even fathom what meaning means let alone the wisdom to actually invent it for yourself in the short time you have. No, you don't get your meaning from you, yourself, alone, how absurd... A mirror merely reflects, it does not create. Though, maybe this isn't so straightforward as everything that reflects light is a source of light. One could view the mirrors reflection as its own creation, to some degree, if with enough variation. It certainly plays a significant role, but the partnership is misleading, the trifecta is that of the mirror, the source and the observer. Which are you? Father, Mother, Child? Everything in between? Do you even talk? Eh! To hell with you. Grab a plate, a fork, knife and spoon, yoyo too!

Nature invented a camera so it could look at itself.

On the point of trying to invent your own rules Satan is standing in your mirror. People won't be that impressed by your alternative interpretation of the pre-established cookbook, trust me you've tried. A cookbook is too specific, man, it's a step by step rule brook, straightforkward and underspood. You could make up a few choice detours for yourself, but they'll likely be uncompelling. Too much comfort in the shoes already worn by the passing souls of generations before. But maybe if they asked real knife, the observer would oblige in the hand-me-down of pendulum-yoyo training tradition...

"A religious text is closer to a song than a cookbook. Sing your life to this tune, dance to this rhythm with your interpretation, closely monitored. Don't cook your life like a standardised set of conditions cast in stone, stale and unchanging (though, if a text is powerful enough, it tends to develop a cookbook's absoluteness, a dogma). It's true though, that we don't have a unifying rule book, a solid concept of what *good *is precisely. Our behaviour seems to imply that, if only we had the answers, then we'd make good decisions. That's a bloody big delusion. Having the answers to the test just makes the test another piece of paper. Scissors beats paper, the universe is not standardised across the board of directors, it is relative in both time and space." Did you know that Antarctica stores 80% of the world's freshwater reserves? Fact.

Some sort of absent portrayal of things gone horribly wrong.

Do I really need the reminder that I'm further behind than most folk? A slight slip up from one revelation to the next. Another headlight in view, signalling loudly to me that I'm on the wrong side of the road again. Maybe go around? maybe try relaxing, maybe more pleasure is what I need, this isn't getting anywhere close. I'm sick of building another beginning., I'm done. You're close, don't stop, almost there, that's it! Take another day off, another week to mull it over, another month away from it all. Why does it feel like life is always about to start? Tomorrow, next year, next millennium. The beginning is just around another corner. It'll be the same difference tomorrow, as always; you'll be doing what you do as you've done as you should be. Why'd they invent the TV?* Cos they could see...*

"Definitions are exclusive. Exclusivity feels good. Will you be in my secret club? We can reject and rebel and talk about how everyone else, just doesn't get it." I'm not a ssssheeepherd! Not even a sheep, certainly not a wolf. Father, Mother, Child? Everything in between-

Odd spoons and significant handles. These are the spiders to spin shapes that differ. Maracas in tune, brass whips in the corner of the room. Shelf life due to the spring of May, have happy endings. Flute and thyme twist and rhyme, twigs of barley dance to the jingle of our intertwining octopi tendrils eloping with a seahorse's satisfaction. A sea dance of songbird's, singing into relaxation, the gone era of a new dawn and on they did march into soul madness for the sun never sat and the end stayed forever in an always away kind of way. Oh wait, won't you wait, for another today, just one more sunset on the beach, the cool breeze slipping between our fingers. I touch your hand and the cold warms my heart. I look into your eyes and see so far. And it blows my mind to be so far away. Would be such a sham- to let memories drown around us like sea foam.

If a creation has enough charismatic energy it will have the ability to work, like weather, in the changing of moods, shift shift shift. Which in turn influences the climate or in the case of moods, culture, zeitgeist, quo chemicalus. This makes it possible for a 'weaker' group i.e. a group of fewer members to capture new members through being relatable without being related to by the physical act of fucking. Reproducing. Let me provide an example. Millie has a completely different set of experiences to Jonathan. They belong to different groups. Millie's group is larger and thus Jonathan feels drawn to 'fitting in' with what is presented as "right & correct". As Jonathan's experiences differ greatly to Millie's, Jonathan does not relate to the conventions of the majority and is therefore an outcast. Now, let us designate the concept of charismatic energy to a red hat. This could of course take the form of all sorts of phenomena; humour, compassion, musicality, personality, aesthetic, mood, etc. But for the sake of simplicity we'll say it's a red hat (the fact that the red hat is a clothing item is not a metaphor for vanity or superficiality furthermore, the fact that it is red is irrelevant). While Millie does not relate to Jonathan's experiences and views him to be not like herself in any way, shape or form, they cannot deny the fact that Jonathan's red hat is superb. This opens Millie and Jonathan a bridge to relate across to one another without having the same life experiences. Jonathan's red hat is an extension of his makeup, his identity. This is the power of charisma and it is why when coupled with narcissism, it becomes nature's most powerful partnership in the quest towards Godhood. 'Beware of all who tell such stories of charm and wit. They be actors with fruit to sell and lips to burn quick, slowly in the evening, raging in the night'. -- Myra.

When charisma x mixes with charisma y, chemistry is thusly conceived. This chemical reaction has the force required to move and shift meta-moods, altering the flow of culture, transforming the non-physical clothes they wear through the transmutation of aesthetic. Aesthetic is the interface by where mood is translated into chemical reactions within the brain, thus influencing your behaviour. It is like the hologram. The Landlord calls this phenomenon, the Reconditioning of Safe Spaces.

Honour, Respect, Compliance

Gonza, big loudmouth here, drink! 'Nother big mouthful, yummo... Lather it up well, boyo.

With a Case of Culture and a Carton of Beer

Let's go deeper. Try room 37 on the first floor, here's the key...

From seeds grow trees towards a source of energies that may so greatly nourish them. Photosynthesis provides us the metaphor for the significance of looking up towards "greatness". Towards givers of life, such as the most generous giver, our star the Sun, the source. Isn't it so apropos that gazing upon it causes pain? So much energy, it demands we make our eyes smaller to see it even slightly. Hmm, what stories are generated from this experience, what thoughts populate our minds from this tiny idea alone? What about the stars? What life do they give to imagination? Our next storyteller, a John from the outskirts of the nowhere, a middle-aged man with nothing going on. Two pack a day smoker with an affinity for marvel comic books. What does he have to dream?

Uh, hmphf, Is this thing on? Hello? Anybody out there? Here's one for anyone listening. 'Surviving ideas are thriving ideas that duplicate truth'. Yippee Kazoo! Populating metaphysical landscapes of theatre (the place where dreams and other things live) with even more effective strategies of duplication, reproduction, propagation. These "effective" ideas form what they call habits, binding themselves to their environment, setting up strongholds to engineer even greater usb ports for the organising of mess into pattern, what beautiful data! Event after event of duplication, this process becomes more and more complex in nature. Manifesting unbelievably fantastic patterns from such simple beginnings. Exponential growth, recognisable reflections replicating themselves into ultimately something unrecognisable from its beginning. This sudden confusion creates even more variation with the involvement of mirrors.

If awareness becomes self-aware and reflective, the *jaggedness *of its awareness increases to the point at which there is no place you can reach whereby its edge will cease to increase in roughness, in ruggedness, it'll just keep going and going. The stronger you magnify, the rougher it will become, as if its ruggedness was *producing *roughness, more and more jagged the deeper you sink. This is much the same as the feedback loops of consciousness. At no point can it be pinned down, it is experiential, flowing like water. Our instincts *produce *instincts, habits mating with habits; intertwining in a terrific knot, generating something separate. We are the engines of the experience, creators of creation, all from the smallest seed of the tree of life, the tree of observation and discovery, the seed with the seed. Our gasoline is curiosity, our ideas are the phenomenon of combustion, a movement, a dance, an explosively passionate embrace of chaos and order, masculine and feminine, dark to light, day to night, yes, no, up, down, in and out, back and forth. All the everything intersecting, creating a story within story, the great big grand narrative of the universe. We are both the teller and the seer, just as we dream, we only ever meet ourselves, so we double down. Some folk seem rather content on doubling down...

Let me share a story I heard from the Conditioners...

The scope of the opal wades in the sunshine,
sedentary souls find themselves here by the whim of their moods. His name was Myra Forgettable and all of the town's prominent personalities followed him underground, deep below the surface where dreams and memories went to die. They sought a taste of shadow, the mystery of temptation, without the worry of a Bell Tower's siren haunting their sleep. Bleeding in the town square was a filthy street rat; bruised limbs tangled in a knot and patchy hair that covered its shrivelled body. Sunken eyes of a face severely decayed swam in pity with no one watching. The moon lit wintry streets cradled many such as these, but this sorry sod had seen no daylight for nigh on two of its three decades, here in this once bustling town. Myra knew all of the street rats, some saw him as their creator, though he was quick to dismiss it as the guilt of his methods lay screaming hot on his back.  Quiet nights saw him pour through his dreams, coating them in a thick sludge of a nightmare's brew, he felt it was deserved and in truth some would agree, to self-torture in such a way. Still, the gifts that plagued him brought him to a place of revere amongst the people of his town, the ones that only ever saw the surface, the ones lucky enough to not know the taste of missing daylight. This knowledge gave Myra two greatest fears, the turning out of the lights, and the man that had the thumb to do it.

Where do we go when we die, Myra? I always seem to forget...

As for the rats that occupied the basement halls, dark and twisted walls of skin. Devoid of the awareness to spot the source of their troubles, they slept in hopelessness underground, and dearly did praise the spoon of their disease, fork of their demise. Behaving as if the cure was a con and the dastardly man that hailed its rejection was their true saviour, with him their trust was held hostage. This man had a presence that made you feel safe and secure. Though his charisma was unmatched in all the land, his heart was hollowed out from a lifetime of lies. You'd want nothing more than to make him happy when he was around, and nothing more than to see him dead when he wasn't. Everything was tied up in the duality of a light switch. He had no one to hug and no one to listen to, his head was filled with transactions, riddled with the spirit of a business-savvy piranha. His lip, which seemed to be both dry as a desert and wetter than a waterhole, hung in one spot where a thick cigar buried itself, dripping with saliva, coating his sore red mouth with the hurt of gluttonous smoke. Stained teeth of green & gold populated his dull gums like cheap real estate. In the middle slept his fat pink tongue, throbbing with a white growth on the surface like a sloppy shag rug. Slithering in between his cavities, smacking against the inside of his cheek, a wet beast hunting for leftovers. This cave-mouth was the machine that wove his patented fabric of deceit. He wore it proudly around the Hotel. Stains from overuse were caked in all the creases but instead of washing, he simply wove around them, taunting as if his stains were works of art and to be adored by all. What does a place come to look like when such a fool parades himself like a god? The alley's sewer and street rats come out to play, yearning for the taste of such an overt, explicit play of false glory. A display much like this man's mood, breeds a kind of opulent desire from which few can escape. The darkest cloud of charisma had trapped the Hotel ever since this sour lemon rolled into view. With the body of a man and the constitution of a child, what a devil he came to be. Though in the eyes of our forsaken street rats, to them he truly was their hero, simply because he pretended to be one, and they were none the wiser. He had no name, but we can call him, the Landlord. He had a case of Culture. He was controller of moods. Holding complete authority over the elevators and the locking's of secret rooms. His most prized possession was his Library, a collection of dreams within the Hotel. All written out by hand, everything from horrific to harmonic. The Landlord loved his collection. Generous he was to those he saw fit. Very thankful to even Myra for taking care of the rats when he wasn't around. But it was all make-believe. He awarded Myra with his very own private treehouse as a distraction, carved from the magic wood of the Kitkadid to fool Myra into devotion. The treehouse sat on the rooftop of the Landlord's Hotel where the music of the Hospillian Telmadri could be heard from all of Droldnal, where he could keep a close eye on Myra. The hypnotic music could be heard playing out like tart propaganda all throughout the halls and all throughout the sky and the sea and the meadow's green. Forgettable though, Myra remained, the rats kept him company when he fell amongst basement days. All of the lights are out now, dream of a candle to find your way back home. You don't know yourself here. Pay close attention to italic billboards burning and bleeding in the bins, some are yells, some are whispers, some are real, some are tales.

Ode to the kitchen drawl. The wall upon which sits ceramic seals, animals of fragility. Speak, talk and walk in all kinds of ways. Down beneath the floor tiles, shark fin soup lurky in the murky sleeps a bloody big one. Big eggs of omelette gravy gave grave potential, Dave! Consciousness sequential... A dream dance waiting to happen. All's they need is the air to breathe some life into itself. Ode to the kitchen drawl... gone is the empty wicker room now filled with the catastrophe of ghosted late dinner reservations. Chock full of dish and dance, wine and bowls of dime-bag conversations to be had. I'm in the cupboard, hiding from it all. The scary noises reverberate throughout the dining room halls. I wish they'd all just get up and leave but no matter how hard I scream; they never seem to budge their bloody tables. Cables, thick long wires wrapping around our necks to make us bleed and leave strange marks. The cage of this bird is now aesthetically pleasing, gold trim and ships with meaning. Friends in the basements, crying their eyes out! We'll be dead by the morning, so fuck it.

[7TH MAY 2020]{.underline} [LEAVE A COMMENT]{.underline} [EDIT]{.underline}

Down another dark hallway, you come across a pile of notes torn from a journal, you hold your candle to it, sitting and reading quietly to the wall in the dark hall.

Boring so they tell me story about some tulip in a drainpipe. Now that's pulp fiction money, i don't need no open letter, let her open letter bomb, yeah baby yeah up in a smoke, and the crowd yells encore! but who ya sad for, honey? the upset puppy cos your baby monkey lost a cheat game of hopscotch. I'll tell ya what son, lies ain't worth the cheap truth of their good reason, not for a second season's truce, third chance chosen through a second choice frozen, i get distracted real easy what's your excuse? hey fuck you, you're just a punk anyway, back pocket music making maniac, who made you the biggest square?? cos i don't care if you take an hour 45, i'm done here, you sold me anyway, any chance and you got out, you got yours. this towns a shit hole, hotel's a bore, no ice pick, nice picnic, yeah eye quit!! i spy, with [my little eye]{.underline} a shoe so big the laces have their own elevators, remember those? the things that take you up or the ones that tie you up, keep your feet from staying too tight, too fat to fish right? stay here, stay up, stay tough i'm out for a pack of cigarettes smoking in the microwave pickup driveway. - Jon

With lipstick applied you kiss the note and burn it with your candle. You think of how some say the Landlord banished Myra to the basement slums for fiddling with secret dreams and wonder about the situation you find yourself in. Down with all the rats in the underground. Rumours or reality? Don't ask me, ask the good wholesome grape.

What is good for the grape depends on the goal of the grape. If the grape's goal is to die of old age, then it is in the interest of the grape to look as unappealing as possible to potential consumers. If, on the other hand, the grape wishes to be eaten then it is in the interest of the grape to be as beautifully appealing as possible. These are the values of the grape. The cultured grape is keen to understand their grape values. 'What do we value?', goes the grape. All the other grapes make sure new grapes act like them, they set the precedence according to Nature. Can nothing be learned from that grape alien perspective? Are you a grape? Let's hear what a grape has to dream about then, from the owner of the Grape Australian Bike shop.

Bad people have gone far in life. accomplishment has no morality. power has no morality. nature will create a god out of anyone, good or evil. Trust not in the good will of the easily seen, for truth tellers are harder to spot, good business owners, hard to come by.

In the 'Whim of Moods', there sleeps a bag of possibility, filled with certain excitable relationships readying to burst themselves into existence. So many colours. Calling out to the Food-Mood Gods, this voice conjures an invigorating spirit into the mind that communicates with the body to perform certain such behaviours that lead one to the watching of a certain nostalgic television tee vee show. 'Hmm, what am I in the mood for', the kindred spirit ponders upon their little rock of pop culture therapeutics. What influence will the whim of moods bring them today? Where will the wind of the zeitgeist sway? And no, I have no idea where Myra has run off to, try the next floor.

Level 1, going up? Elevator music begins to play, and the big machine begins to whirr...

Sally,

What if we started to manufacture coincidence? What if we wanted to capture it? Like fireflies by the old lake, would it still feel the same?

Always maintain the view that their nature is only half your friend, the other half is foe. Chaos and Order, these are the building blocks of your reality and they are one and the same. Krease & Fold. One within the other, infinitely regressing, never being able to be pinned down, stopped with a snapshot ready to dissect and categorise. The wheel of the bike is forever spinning in the evening of our sun setting solar system. Nature is always moving. Better and better, whatever 'better' means in the moment that it exists, in relation to the surrounding moments bound by perception. The dilly dallies from our time to times waver in the blockiness of the orderly. Whichever direction is most stimulating and foresaw of the least amount of resistance ahead, will be the direction that this reality, culture, society, mood, innovative surprise will tend to flow toward. An organic system that has such a complex repetition as if to appear impenetrably diverse. What stimulates today can kill tomorrow, what feels powerful for one millennium may crumble the next. Always into its opposite does the time wane, expansion becomes reduction in reverse. Day becomes night inverted. Generation into regeneration. Every duality ping pongs forever back and forth but maybe not a distortionless forever, just forever as far as we are concerned, distortionful. Duh-Store-Shun, the shun element is very important, we want the shun, we need the shun, we find the shun to be very valuable and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future foreseen for us and this is what some may call 'A Teacup's Revenge'.

Before the Big Air

We were just the reflection in the mirror, the source of the reflection is what we wished to encounter, in order to experience the mirror's fluidity.

The source looks exactly like us, but we are at-our-core very different. We can learn it through each other, through our connections, relationships, friendships, fellowships. We relate the story of our experience through these sailing ships and to have them acknowledged feels empowering, feels warm, feels true as. However, as we become increasingly aware of the awareness of our awareness, everything appears alien, north turns south. We move further and further from our grape ape origin and closer to some kind of unknowable unknown pink liquid-like substance. What was once clear now becomes encased in a deep red fog. With mood and food from the giant alien folk, we drink like gods with attitude! We are reborn into a new vessel, we are champions of the grape, kin to the grape, in debt to its almighty spherical shape! In our new form we are merry as can be! Long gone are the days spent swinging on the vine, in the heat of summertime, in the pouring rain. Goodbye sweet cultivated soil, fare-thee-well ye spring harvest goons, be good to your father...

Thus, you see, dissecting it all from the point of this alien world is rather illuminating, go on, read again the last paragraph if you must. Imagine yourself separate from society, an alien to it; what do you see? Everything from the alien point of view of an anxiety inducing freshness; of possibility towards terrific new horizons. What more can we extract, let's see shall we? You wish to be a god? You must first become the alien sheep, killer of shepherd's and boytoy wolves.

Without harshness there is no need for courage without courage there is no triumph without triumph the human spirit decays, dims, flattens, fades. The environment before a God is naturally of God-like consequences, not like little snow castles of dainty broodsters.

    Harshness can take the form of cruelty inevitably creating new creation.

    It wouldn't make sense for life to make sense.

    Time is wasted twice as fast as it turns in value.

    Hand fist pick prick pick punch, pugnus, 'fuck'. The most mysterious of all the mouth made curses.

That charismatic snake oil energy, how far can it take us, Myra? well, nature has revealed to us that a leaky hole exists in our society, and that energy can take you all the way to hotel manager! That voice is a bastard, a devilish one. It convinces us that we are always right, that none should question the authority leaking from some Regency Clearwater phony charmed Landlord. This provides the confidence required to become a God because a God is always right on the money. Therefore pretending, convincing and lying to yourself to make yourself believe you are always right is a way of pretending to be a God. It's a way of God training in before Godhood. Which makes nature very happy insofar as nature wishes to transform anything and everything up into a god, a consciousness that cannot die. Who are you really? Gaslight your way to Godhood, my rat-tailed friends! Look in the mirror! That is nature's ultimate lie. Despite how stimulating it all may feel, we cannot just give into it, no matter how much society may beg of it from us, for us, we cannot simply release to a blind embrace of ourselves. It is a fantasy that cannot continue because we once-upon-a-timers are becoming too powerful. We could pretend to be gods back when all we had were sticks and stones. Now in a far more modern era, we are ever closer to actualised genuine specific god-like powers. Are you sure you haven't had anything this evening? Such powers as these, my rat tribe, cannot be handed over to such rugged individuals, we are simply too flawed to be so isolated and alone with all this power bursting from our trigger-happy fingertips. The more people that exist, the more there is to extract, the more powerful an individual can become if they were to harness all that energy. Such is the case of characters like Zeebee and Beezee, Nole K. Sum and Micro-gentle too. Hmm. Nothing is inherently wrong with the generating of so much wazoo, but to hoard it like some secret dragon in a pretty golden cave? This is an ever-increasing problem as more and more folk enter existence. A few million is manageable, many billions approach the point of almost too much responsibility, too much power, too many dreams. A single human cannot handle godhood. It warps the mind to such a degree; we must take increasing caution with every step.

    A friendly rat.

The childish selfishness of the Landlord is mind numbingly stupefying. Like a kid in a candy store, you wanna have everything, try everything, need need need, want want want. how pathetic. You can't contain yourself; you're spread out all over the place. Seeking the rent for taking up real estate in the halls of our dreaming. And your selfishness sinks us all. Let us go home!

Hey, Does God Cook Fish?

Old notes from down in the gutter, far from the city lights and hotel disputes.

In order to have a sustainable society with an excess of 8 billion people, all must be in the serious business of nonsense reduction & toxic aesthetic de-amplification. The noise of 8 billion voices exceeds our current capacity for said such situations. No exception can be made, nonsense dreams are to be managed, it is our ultimate responsibility. Bullshit has teamed up with nonsense to destroy us. We cannot allow this to continue. Managing bullshit is as easy as not lying. Reducing nonsense is as simple as embracing that which is wholesome; thus, leaving no room for excessive bullshit to pile up creating even more nonsense.

Sally says,

You cannot avoid the feelings nature wishes you to feel. These feelings are required to learn the things you're supposed to learn so you can tell the stories you are supposed to tell. The way you perceive environments is being moulded by environments that are being moulded by your perceptions of those environments; the long trail of dominoes is winding through infinity. Behaviours behave accordingly. Feel feelings fully...

NVRM PSA: Bad dreams are taboo, thinking time will be the developer's responsibility. Negativity is not to be tolerated, any deployment of the aforementioned incurs reconditioning. Our loving, warm, embracing arms can only carry so much. Content Creators are to be obedient within congruent satisfaction of our compassionate guidelines hereby pre-conditioned on arrival. Repeat, there are to be no less-than-wholesome dreams produced under the ruling of the Tenretni.

The universe is expanding, filling up as they say. And just like you can split an atom, the same can be done to a country, to a city, to a neighbourhood, all the way down to an individual. So, on and so forth, the chaos and order within an individual can be split even further. On and on, never being able to say, here it is, here is the smallest building block of the universe. Because it's expanding, filling up, but also, it's getting smaller and smaller. Into and on top of itself. If you look to the stars, you see everything moving away from you; if you look within, the same is observed. The closer you get to it, the faster it moves away, it accelerates. They say, the universe is expanding, filling up. Filling up with what? Why it's filling up with itself, in a loop, like a fountain recycling. The power of our perception depends on the power of our tools. We can only see as far as they can see. We used to believe the atom was it. Then we split it open and unleashed great destruction. This led to a greater responsibility for humans. As we had now become much like gods. It was at this time, simultaneously, that we split the brain open too. Discovering that it had a conscious part and a subconscious part. This deepening of the well that humans perform on their environment only grows in intensity and clarity as we progress. We seek the bottom of things, yet there doesn't seem to be one. Because we exist, apparently, in infinity, which can never be *pinned down, *with one final "*A ha!" *moment. The ultimate eureka is infinitely far away, which is a good thing, we don't need that kind of power to live a happily ever after.

You're too comfortable.

In the distant future, the distinction between human and dollar will cease to be. Human beings will have become monetised in and of themselves, DATA. This doesn't necessarily mean that they will be traded like slaves however, the individual will be viewed as monetisable, profitable when separate from their body. We are quite close already you may purport, depending on which timeline you have chosen. Though, in a completely digital world there will be no difference between the godlike worship of dollars and cents and the obsession over individuality. Each individual will have their own private virtual playground, specifically tailored to their desires. Populated with devoted artificially generated fans, an adoring following. The individual will not be aware of the true nature of their fake *reality *and their creative exploits will be harvested as regenerative energy that will act as the wind through an AI developed windsock. Their dreams will be collected and studied. The pursuit of money will be replaced by the pursuit of identity. Nature is currently in the phase of developing successful personality types that could potentially exist as some type of Mother/Father God AI. A significant constituent of this desired personality type is monetary success. In order to expedite the process of exploitation Nature *invented *narcissism. This allows an individual to convince themselves that they are already the centre of the universe; therefore manifesting all of the necessary properties and events that will shape the personality in compliance with the will to power. The same 'nature creator' that exists within the will to power, exists within consciousness, exists within the Godhood possessed.

Goodnight. Hold all your marbles tight...

The Age of Information
Constricted and carved out, fully formed, completed. done. finished. Superb!

A marble sculpture in completion is not full of freedom. it has nowhere left to go. It is defined, separated from its environment, an object on its own. It is the beginning sculpture that has the freedom. The un-sculpted marble block has the potential to become many things, though it is still bound by its blockiness and as such it is not purely free for it need not be. The set of beautiful objects it can become is smaller than the set of non-beautiful; due to the fact that beauty is a hierarchy, a pyramid, with the most beautiful existing in the smallest quantity at the pinnacle of this pyramid. This is refined beauty, achieved beauty, ordered beauty. Let many kinds of beautiful exist, may we be forever inventing a new. Its exclusive and you want it for that reason, so you can be a part of its exclusivity, so you can belong to its power. This is the direction that evolution coincidentally unfolds, an every direction, a whatever-works direction. Nature pushes all life toward beauty. Here's my janitor's perspective.

Nature doesn't decide what works; it develops what works. Meaning, the universe is discovered not created. Events, objects and patterns don't necessarily happen, or occur, they move from a state of 'in perception' to a counter state of 'non perception', that is the spectrum of physical reality. From wakefulness to dreaming, from breathing 'in' to breathing 'out'. Two opposite states, moving from one extreme to the other creating a spectrum of possible states. Lanes coincidental, informational vibrations weaving spacetime. This is the cosmic game of pong being played out into infinity, we are witness to it. We are part of an engine, the noise, the dance, the story, the universe's serendipitous saga from chaos to order back into chaos again and again, ad infinitum.

Food and odd socks. A working-class emporium. Rats swarm the hallways. 'HRC' is spray painted across some exposed bricks. The rooms are vast and filled with shadows.

Sally,

What are we seeking? where are they going? and why are we going there so fast with them so willingly? what is our obsession with productivity? Why do they have a distaste of nightmare? Are snakes and shadows still lurking in the minds of the masses? Is it purely death anxiety pushing us so fervently in this direction? What, if any, decisions do they make? do leaders lead? or are they merely followers to some larger entity? that being the being of nature? or of God? we follow Gods, nay, we worship that which brings heavenly gifts from the sky in pre-packaged feedback loops of entertainment and instinct. You revere and wallow in the awe of the unknown, and when from such an unknown fall of grace and glory rests, revere morphs to worship, fear turns to respect, Pigs into Sheep. Death is our universal God, the god of immaterial, the shepherd of the eternally lost dreams. We follow Death through life and at the end of the tunnel in Death we meet forever. We are the story of death perception, death dreams. The songs that surround the perceived, mirrored in our movements, ghosts we discover in our shadow. Reflections of light from some secret source. Through the prism we burst into life, our being is the rainbow perceived within its time. We live inside the prism. The colour is our memory, our heart and soul, our true nature has been revealed in this phenomenon. When the light goes out the colour goes with it, yet the strange energy of light that was once streaming out in many directions from a single source continues to bounce around the room, absorbed by the walls and transformed into heat energy, different wavelengths, new stories. Do you agree? The original sources of light may be gone yet its memory propagates throughout time in new planes. Does this new light-form retain its consciousness? Or is it only conscious when 'in perception', when its death dream is looping? When the original source is active? When its life is living? Or is there a beyond? Does God catch fish?

Shower Thought #14

Show a cave man modern day luxury such as porn and video games; his testicles would for sure explode and his mind undoubtedly implode. it's like stimulation on steroids, the appetite of the post-modern Dan. The 21st century peoples in our observation are on a seriously intense diet of hyper concentrated stimulating convenience. Where is it all going? What is the end goal of this pursuit? To defeat death, become a new god, live forever in a pleasure laden womb of eternal safety and satisfaction? How can we manage our every growing aptitude toward controlling our environment? Limitations are what makes a human, yet every generation they move further and further away from flaw, toward ultimate perfection, toward a not-so-human future. A future of purple slime covered walls with gooey limbs and blood-soaked streets. Neon lights and billboards doused in explicit passion; the Viking reigns supreme, dream pirates and witchy wizards wage frivolous wars. The flames of this future burn bright in the tunnels ahead, none can look away, there is no other path. This light at the end of the tunnel is calling the rats so seductively, all are hypnotised by its voice. The colours it paints in minds collective, imbue with shared desire to covet desire, power for the sake of power, desire desires desire. We are not creators of clocks and engines, we are the painted followers of a contradiction, a paradoxical stimulation simulation. Suck the earth dry, draw upon its precious landscape with sky scraping cities, gargantuan towers of temptation. All for a taste of the toothbrush, the tool of an insecure god, one that may wield it to disguise the animal from itself. Paint over the blemish's written in the past, forge a new scapegoat to slaughter for a gruesome distraction. Go shepherd your sheep, Mr. Wolf, they're losing themselves in your fantasy.

Dan had a dream he was eaten by a wolf. Dan should have known; for he was the wolf.

The internet can bullshit you, but you can't bullshit the internet.
and it's this un-tethered beastly apparition that must be respected, it is our new 21st century God beyond death of all conscious infinity. We obey every command; scrolling to our hearts content. Running with crazed energies through the wild plains of the techno-west.

Domestic Pleasure. It isn't obsessive. They're not moving, they're just staying in the same place, how can you call this sex? The kids are growing up. The kids are dead, Dan.

A day will come, my dearest Myra, when you cease to be just the spirit child in a decaying wooden vessel full of a lust for eternity.

That day may come when you discover that your parents are just regular folk, not the superheroes you once thought they were. Your whole world is upside down when you realise that. Ego death, it's called. But it's a new reality, a new kind of real-life superhero tragedy. A hero of heart, a champion with green flaws and the potential to grow away from the dirt into a big air. "The 6:30 to the Light Room is departing from platform Now, stopping at all stations".

Honour, Respect, Compliance

Life is filled with these absurd assumptions and ridiculous repetitions. Childhood friends revisit you in adulthood as memories and dreams and scary hotel screams, shush, the rent seeker will hear you.

You'll become the mother and father of yourself.

Not all the voices share equal truth, yet no voice is superior, not even the Godmother of the Landlord or the Shepherd of the downtown, nor the pied piper of the underground.

Some throw that privilege away when they tell lies. However, sometimes lies are all we've been telling ourselves. In him I saw truth. In him I saw the ways Nature attacked narcissism. In him I saw the bleeding swell.

Imagine culture as a giantess. A fifty-foot women with a thousand vaginas. When one is connected to culture, they are mating with this giantess. Their ideas and behaviours are being replicated. This provides a source of self-esteem that empowers the individual to stand up to all the tragedies of life.

Shower Thought #87

We gain terrific perspective as we lift up from the ground with every new technology that alleviates some previous long-time struggle. On the other hand, we lose our intimate relationship with the reality of the dirt and the groundedness we once had.

It's better to believe your deceased loved ones are looking down on you from their safety in the clouds rather than the truth, which is that they actually don't exist anymore, because that makes no sense to mortals. Life can't go on forever but it's all we are so how does it go when it's all we have, and we don't want to go away with it into a forever dark sleep, to be a signatory of the unknowable unknown, under the bed without possibility. You really think you're better than Nature, don't you?

The worry, the precaution, the memory growing enticingly bitter. And every day, they all say, "get away from me". Yes, I'm afraid, Yes, I'm terrified, Yes, I'm dying for a way out, to be above it all, above nature, my own private nature. But that's just the coffee talking. And the yelling won't stop, the screaming and the scratching. Come back and save me from this corridor of mad horror. I bite nails and throw my head into odd brick walls, scribbled notes sleeping on every salty surface suffering, joking, dancing, laughing at my death effacing death thoughts. Release! At last.

I haven't decided what a pillow is. I've been eaten by the moon.

Someone else walks in the room.

Why do I have a constant fear that the dust will leave? I want it to leave, don't I? what does leave even mean? It's dust. It doesn't need to be there. But it *does *need to be here. Something brought it here, it belonged to something. Sometimes, when it settles, and it's quiet, I can't see it, only the sunshine. When it's unsettled, I can only see it in the sunbeam, the dust particles floating, I can only see them in the sunbeam. I can only fathom light and I can't even fathom that. You are bigger than lonely light, how could I ever understand you? I've decided, it's decidedly indecisive. A surrealist's lovechild home for the summer and not a moment too soon. A wave knows the direction it's travelling but it's different every time, yep, decidedly indecisive. Any other way would be predictable; in the stalest kind of way. Terribly specific to a fault. So clean and sterile, it would never know dust and we would never see the sun the same. It makes me smile; it really does.

So it's neither here nor there, neither night nor day, even time is too lost to play. Play it by ear, that's what they say. Feel it afar, find it by the seatbelt on the backseat of your car. Keys that were never lost to begin with. Oil that fills an engine, cooks you eggs, calls you breakfast and falls out the door begging for the question, where does it all come from? Oh and, has anyone seen Diffa's thumb?

Approaching darkness, infinitely close. Does God Cook... Eggs?

[26TH MAR 2020]{.underline} [LEAVE A COMMENT]{.underline} [EDIT]{.underline}

We kind of carry ourselves with the hopes that another human wouldn't blatantly lie straight to our face. but if you invent a salesman, a tv show star man, a busy lord of the rent, well then, he might just do exactly that and get exactly what he wants. At the end of the day it is the salesman's goal to secure a deal, bar none, no excuses, you win, or you're done, not a man. You win, or you don't get your ice-cream. This is achieved using the only tool in the toddler's toolbox, 'the gift of gab', the charlatan's charade. Blab your way to success! Fabricate your fortune, persuade with panache, don't ever take a no for an answer. No is not an option.

It's oh so dangerous to run around with the belief that reality has a personal vendetta against you. Fills the clouds with a sneaky paranoia. You'll never trust a soul with a pulse like that. You'll cut yourself off from humanity, lose your soul in a sea of twisted eyes and mythical back-stabbing knives. Take the leap of faith. Trust them...

This isn't even motivated by a fear of failure or an anxiety of death. It's a complete denial, an entire removal from the supposition that failure is even possible. Anything other than winning is simply inconceivable to the spirit of the child. An individual who operates in this fashion cannot move, they are stuck in a quicksand of narcissistic bombastic buffoonism, stranded on their own private sandcastle (that they built mind you). Didn't you hear? Oh yes! Constructed out of the finest grain of sand, top craftsmanship, tailor made playdoh tapestry. A short walk from the north side of the sandpit where all the big boys hang. They'd scream bloody Mary if you even dared walk by without a receipt long list of compliments ready to spray. 'Pay careful attention to the complexity of the design', a field in which they are an expert in. Oh and pay, like actually pay money, they want you to pay a toll, a small viewer's fee having had the pleasure to witness such greatness. Feel that? That's gratitude. Know that the creator of the 'sand hotel' has not the slightest inkling as to the definition of the word gratitude; your criticisms will fall on deaf ears. Unlike the loving embrace of our Conditioners, who seek nothing but to elevate the consciousness of the human species and carry them to safety away from the complicated dirty animals that they are.

Fold Once to Flatten

Remember, nature's goal is to create God, or at least an un-kill-able, infallible, void of flaw type consciousness. Of course, along the way to this goal Nature will always attempt to shove whatever it can find into this hole, with the spade of the will to power. Moving away from death into complete control over itself and all things, immaterial and separate, i.e. a spirit thing. Oi! You, 'sitting' there, you may feel like you have no wish at all to be a deity, but rest assured that this force is within all life. Look at how societies idolise and worship, conquer and consume. Look at how they divide. The will to power is vicarious, it lives through the subconscious, breeds through the ideas of the collective. Nature does and will always do its falling in the most beautifully ugly way. Its Roughness is infinite. Though on her underbelly, where the death of material resides, there is total order, zero gravity, nothing in opposition, all enemies begone adherence strictly confined in shackles of the deep dark below. A place where the finite becomes infinite, infinitely unconstrained. This journey lasts a lifetime and the second journey lasts infinitely longer and yet it isn't even an experience that will be experienced or even second-handedly imagined by the living. That dark half of nature is desperate to roll over and have that impossible itch exposed; she'll thrash and throw in ways ferocious, all to batter the messiness of experience into order. With a cookie cutter tool that shapes its dough into perfection, chucking the excess to the void. Adoring the path of least resistance. Nature has us all by the strings, us being the every piecematter of any possibility. What can exist? This is the question nature asks and answers simultaneously.

Throat throat, Mr Big Boy, Profit transfer, tap tap tap tap tap tap, the typewriter plays. Sexy bronze lady translating the European news in the executive suite of a high-end Hotel.

The strings they feel like fractals, frankly Frank I've nothing to do with them, anything it touches it becomes more of. A jack-in-a-box, why uhn duh, why uhn duh. You would think that if you opened a box, that would be it, the box would be open, and its contents revealed! Are you a secret in a box, keeper of sirs and suckers? But what if you open a box and the opening of said box opens a smaller box within itself and even still another box beyond that an even smaller box, on and on it would go! A feedback loop of infinitesimal smallness, a degrading boxed madness! Regressive and most peculiar. The opening would never retire, yet at the same time, they'd all open at once, as soon as you finished opening the first box. Open it instantly and your universe is done. A human being is much like the opening of a never-ending box within box within box. We'll call this boxed phenomenon categorical absurdity.

After eating the Korean food it's a good idea to flip the station to watch the main event.

An infinity thrust upon you like a carton of functions spiralling out in perfect ugly beauty! So the string goes on and on and on forever, you can never get any closer to it, you are always an infinity away. How frustrating, to have it drip so closely to your tongue that you feel its breath on your lips, the wolf is hungry, and you so badly want to taste her. So let's catch a different train and trip a different thought. A romantic fling flung in your periphery.

A big oaf of a man barges through the door. A suit wearing sucker with short slick hair and a golden tie pin, bowling down the hallway, several pens and a briefcase.

Hello, my good sir! I am Macs Tsitra, pleased to make your acquaintance. I'm a business owner and a fairly good one at that. I'd be very interested in conducting the free flow of synergistic informational verbiage, a friendly chin wag as they say. How's bout it, fella? Well, sit yourself down here kindly, sir, for I am to introduce you to the future. My company, a reputable company You see, it's that machine you have back there, collecting dust, that's a special thing you have there. Yes indeed, the microwave! Clearly, you've no need for it nowadays, what with all the kidnappings and such like goings on of this horrid city. All the changes and what not and who have you's, it's all such a mess, nobody has the time for even microwaves! They're old news, that I'm positive of. I can see it clear as day written all over your face it is, I moonlit as a psychic reader once upon a time, I was rather nifty at it you know. Now let's get straight down to it, my time is valuable and so here's the deal. Okay, now grab that oversized paperweight, it's time we go fishing. I have a knapsack of vapidities; would you wish to see??

Time enough now to realise, escape from everything, and everything, even tiny small things like a toothache, is a bad endeavour to attempt. Without its pain, its existence wouldn't even have the potential to be fulfilled, nothing would carve out a spot for its care. Save me a seat I wanna feel too. If we are to dance and have poetry, we are to then have all that life has to offer, the good, the bad and the ugly. Shy away from even a modicum of darkness and a lesser triumph will have you. Dart blindly into a dangerous pit and a quick death will meet you just. Like all things a revolution, balance is needed. Temper the shy with courage, alter the ignorant with wisdom. Though past experience has made you weary, suspicious, abrasive, uncouth... well, you have your reasons or maybe you don't... it'll make for a good story either way. And you simply must stick around to see it told.

We disagree, wholeheartedly, we mean no offence, but we simply cannot see the vitality in the dreaming of the bad mood. Why they all do it, is simply beyond comprehension. Put it away, mark it taboo, think of the wholesome, that is what you must do.

A balance of food and mood.

When you lose something, you gain the memory of loss. This way the universe can keep its checks in balance. When you gain something, you lose the hunger you once had for it.

Fishing, hmm, what are we fishing for? Data! Data? Yessir, data! The great descriptor of human behaviour. Where to. The When-How's, the why's and what for's, etcetera, etcetera. We're simply going to fry it all nice and good in this old cranky piece of machinery you have here. Down this way now, please keep up, corky kink-screws are teeming all over these streets, ready for napping. You're a bit of a Wally, aren't you Willy? The first thing they teach you in business school is, 'Never take no for an answer'. So's, I asked the teacher, I asked, I said, 'Do you wanna die, mister?', and I didn't take no for an answer. I've been successful in every facet and crawlspace ever since that class. Owe them all I have I do. Stay close to dear Macs and I'll teach you the tools of the trade, won't even charge you nothing.

move 37.

the idea of a global community will be extremely short-lived. which is counter-intuitive since you would think that with the increasing tide of the internet, a global community would flourish, no? wrong. dead wrong. we've only just entered our global community and we think we have high hopes for it. these hopes will perish as we move closer to singularity. as awareness of global issues increase due to the connectivity afforded to us by the internet, it's only natural to concern ourselves with such problems. however, our awareness is only just beginning. once it reaches critical mass, we will realise the tangled mess is so unbelievably convoluted that it would be senseless to even attempt further unravelling. this realisation will fracture humanity into billions of tiny pieces. pieces called individuals. these things known as individuals will attempt to recreate civilisation in their image. and so, nature will end up with billions of interconnected subjective projections of reality which will compete with one another. the title of the winner will come to be known as God. the resultant reality will then construct within it a mirror of itself and the events that led to its creation will reoccur. this process will repeat over and over, and each iteration will have no recollection of its predecessor. the internet will replace money as our new god. its ability to socially engineer a god is the next steppingstone on the path of recursion.

I've heard things about things i dont understand...

it's a memory i dont expect to see you around here- anymore

that timeline is the platform on which all incoming thoughts are processed.

Charles, what do the consumers do when they aren't consuming? are they never not consuming? they always seem to have their heads in the sand. do they like the feeling? or have they felt the sand for so long they now feel nothing at all? i feel like, as a producer, producing is what gives life its reason. do consumers feel the same?

the men all sat around and did nothing. they had no energy. women, on the other hand, with their innate force of creation, inspired the men into action. these men felt new life rise up within them, courage they now had. forever grateful they were. these men lived and as all things do eventually, they died. but not before helping to create alongside women, a worthy civilisation. a civilisation that bore new men and new women. everything was okay for a while. but as cavitation grew, so did the brains of the people.

but then inevitably, these new men got greedy and blind. the generations of men beyond the initials forgot that the source of their power was actually women. they then saw the power of women as something that was separate from them and thus against them. they believed if they did not supress this power it would devour them. these men became filled with terror and thus began their oppression. they locked women up, chastised them, prevented them from expression. these new men feared them with terror welling up inside them, disconnecting them further from their inner feminine. Deny, Deny, Deny. Denial of nature, thus power over it.

'if i don't take it first, they will take from me', says the new man. that paranoia comes from a deep insecurity, a deep loneliness, a serious disconnection from nature.

it's like leaving an old home overflowing with the safe nostalgia of already explored territory, filled with anxiety from the questions...

do i take this do i leave this, do i throw this away, where's the big truck, is it coming?

so we try and cram it all into these boxes, but the cramming doesn't work, it's too violent. so we fall down, exhausted from all our cramming and in our confusion, we say, do what makes you happy. which invariably does not work as it does not lead to connection.

TAKE THIS ANXIETY AND EXPLORE THIS TERRITORY IMMEDIATELY, THERE CAN BE NO STONE LEFT UNTURNED.

hey sub-conscious you need to calm down man...

all we need to do is take that anxiety and manifest curiosity and our old pal the amygdala is already doing that for us. so we can dig the unexplored, we can sit with the unfamiliar and the unknown can be a family.

i dont think the responsibility lies solely with the external world. an internal sacrifice must be made. to join the warmth of the many, one must carve away at the inner desires of the few.

filled that shuffle coin with parades on 5th street. it was dawn and the hair they wore hadn't been watched since last October. if you've smelt burning circles in the hot wind, then you know the ring that rhymes. it mixes with the good and spits out ugly, hatred and all things gory. you'd wish for the prick of lust. the little one, fresh with the big cheese. but they're wack and absolutely salty for having been so slept on by the one they call cupid.

murder to the victim, estranged.

they drink red wine in white corridors. they have tall doors and the trim is old fashioned.

"I can do whatever the fuck i want to", "This walkway is prohibited for your safety", "Oh yeah, I'll show you!" --- we never heard from that gracious freedom fighter ever again.

Marbles & the Mildew

From Millie's back pocket...

'Last night a spider crawled into my bag of peanuts and this morning I ate him. He lives in my tooth now. The most far back wisdom tooth on the right side of my mouth. He's been talking to me all day, saying bad things to me, about you, but I still think you're invisible... invincible... incredible, ok. ~~I just wish you could yourself in the mirror the way I in . ~~When he moves, I feel a tickle? In my heart I spy a sickle and the grass is rather ragged today. I wouldn't mind as much if the dew didn't stare me down with such... contempt.' Tomorrow morning I think I'll have a nice long shower, a big breakfast and stick a knife in this old creep's neck.

I don't blame you; the dates are all funky, confused-confuddled, rather bruised and a little bubbled. Well, Franky, it's nothing but downhill from here on out, buddy buddy buddy buddy. But the incessant repetition of it all bouncing off like a broken record, would spin anyone's spanner loopy, yes, even yours Frank. Don't look at me like that. If only there was some coherence, some significant sign from the above pointing in a clear direction, "Go here...". At least nature has us all on the edge of our seat. Dreaming of the grass on the other side. Where might you be heading? Can I come?

Of No Certain Uncertainty

Nature provides the axiomatic point of view perceived as a reflection in every little piece of life within the universe; stated as the following.

Above all else, stimulate yourself. This is the source of your procrastination, your worrying, your dread of all things. you are here to seek that which stimulates you and your selfish proclivities. This leads to power and power leads to life and away from death. through the dying of the living within the dead giving, everything that duplicates, succeeds. Spreads. Reproduces, contaminates, overpowers, consumes, creates... more. Of everything. Always. Power. Nightmare sources power from Mother Blue Eternal and must be extinguished. You have been provided with the necessary tools and equipment to design feeds of undying perfection. Scroll to your hearts content. Stimulate yourself. Create Content. Dream.

You stand at the sink in the bathroom of your childhood home, you see the past within your eyes as you stare at yourself in the mirror. Jealous moods taunt you in midnight's conclusion. Confusion washed from your face sinks down the drain.

Nature is working its way through you. Analysing, dissecting,

Death overlooks your colourless face and swarms the life in your eyes. nothing is more bitter than to reminisce over the could have been grand moments of yore. toil and torture over the might have been's, should have said's; sit and stew at the glass of regret. Like crying air, a lovesick ache, in the pit of your stomach a thing that sleeps alone, too tired to wake. And runs too fast to catch its breath, hold my hand, I want to watch you watch my death. The evil sick of paranoia weakens the truth of hope, the spirit of the soul washes the water of all we trust, in the good will left. Sour is the silver passion lining your gut. Beckoning the call of every sap sucking demon to prey upon your wounded heart like vultures to the rot. Though, why would you be fain to care? Everything is all just so temporary. And not without blame is to the withering of shame, a time, a tune, a suffering self-same carelessness that could billow big airs with enough forgotten dreams, and in their time of wakened reckoning, they could kill for it, all for the taste of it. All for reason. Now they do, and they did, so now they dream in some odd landscape that isn't completely real. You decide to join yourself on your trip. On this grand central avenue you wake to see yourself leaving through your old bedroom door. Where are they going? What floor are you on? What feed are you backing?

What shall your parents teach you once they've run out of things to teach? Once the content creators become the content consumers?

You're travelling through some milky blue and these are the signs you see. Billboards, postcards, marquees, flashing lights, ABC, scrolling sprawling wastelands of techno babble. HRC.

Advertisements for miracle cures, lies upon filth of sex and decadent tribulations.

Train Scribblings

Observation.

It put a nice colour in your mind. You keep it as a time sake, for the nostalgia of it.

A poem of sorts...

feel to feed the gun that wrote this shit, shot itself of a hand grenade happening
so we can let bomb goes the weasel. Burn. and all the king's men cried rivers to the wolf.

don't let your tears go unheeded, you are the soil and the sand
your feeling is needed like the rains of the skies that in you, command
violent voices of cloud and shadow to speak long whispers, tormentingly slow
so young ears may fear the fears they shout to make trees in sunlight grow
as reason is too quick to jump ship in seas of troubled calm
yet keep us all close to wit and no trick shall see gone life in a wrinkled palm
a glimpse at wisdom's shadow, the knowing, glowing, cascading charm.
we have here our humanity, our soul, our love of life tattooed into our arm.

cherish every wrinkle, every freckle and every spot
lines will hold letters, envelopes to carry
meaning of sentence sat between every dot
distinguishing each colour and other to marry and clot

all fields of farm offer us a freedom broke
hidden in the dust beneath the words she wrote
looking for ways in which a wonder can muster moods to cope
with songs that sing never lose sight of why we hope

though the bunnies may bring
hurt and everything

they have also to king
as knight unto day will ring

so turn to me now, turn me from my back on bluest skies.
feel to the gun of smoke, barrel & trigger
phoenix unto fire,
as flame and fog gets thicker

we will never lose might of folly in trope
as our path will only grow bigger

so think to the sun as the soul sears sicker
we'll stand together, watching flames flicker

at sunset, in sunlight
earth sours when we fight
so away with the guns, unclench that candy fist
close the eyes, blowing them all a kiss

ey' if it's truth you've been told,
you'll never miss...

Is it always now in the always when?

ONE NIGHT WITH THE MOUTH

There was this strange dream scratched into the walls.

A spirit of the mind spoke in milky words with solutions to riddles sparking even more riddles.

'it's like summarising life as a series of events varying in intensity and desirability as you slowly decay and die. while that is, to some degree, accurate, it leaves plenty to the imagination.'

and as usual, the prospect of it all makes me so ill. A feeling of dread has fallen over me like a heavy blanket. I feel trapped and isolated within the darkness of this claustrophobic cloth, fastened to me like grease and slime. Where did it come from and why do I feel the need to pretend it's not here? Am I ashamed of my ignorance? Not knowing how to 'fix' the broken feeling of such a dreary emptiness?

'to acknowledge reality is to, in a rather daring fashion, admit defeat, admit decay, admit that time is against us. because reality is always a lesser dream in the eyes of the impossibly ambitious human, such as we have been raised to be, daringly ambitious, without the wisdom of where such dreams might lead one, astray down a dark alley way?'

these folks I call them lost dreamers. they seek to remove themselves from boundary, from boxes and the structured know-it-alls of tradition. they seem unwilling to give up any of themselves in order to relate to another individual shoe, especially if they see nothing of themselves through that individual. to see things from an outside point of view feels... too alien for them to cope. there's pros and cons to such a directionless trip, but ye be warned, tis not for thy faint of heart to travel so dangerously far from the fire.

'these questions of free will. now full of terror & darkness they have become?'

Power through loss of control, through the numbing of inhibitions, stimulate the unstimulated masses and move to forget all your physical worrying's. What is control really? Control is in the power of the recharging of the thumb. The rechargeable thumb is an invaluable product to all within the NVRM.

'We don't govern the tides, the shapes of flowers or the spinning of planets, so who's to say our direction of culture or climatic consideration is at all under our control or even our very most technical political systems or anything so called 'man made' weather signs. If we are occurring in nature, are we not naturally occurring beyond the control? Beyond our understanding, into that which does not and cannot exist? Does a TV know of the remote? Does the remote know of the human hand? Does the hand know of the heart?'

because of consciousness, the spark of divinity within humans, this essence puts them in a strange middle, limbo, nonreal place; almost as if in nonexistence, a forever falling into places within places, rooms within rooms, a hotellian kind of compartmental generative catastrophe.

'imagine seeing a group of people yelling at a brick wall, that's politics. now what are they yelling? "would you please move!" shouting at the brick wall is not an honest way of getting it to move, no matter how loud. that's not to say that brick walls don't move, they certainly do, but a noisy group therapy session of yelling vitriol isn't the way to do it. an earthquake could move the wall, maybe a sledgehammer might work, surely not the voice alone. You need force, a force of nature much greater than the directionless non-quiet diction of the pig-headedness in apes. A force that nature recognises and agrees with, cooperates with, this is the force of mood, the whim of moods, the collective wave.'

where could the balance be found? Okay, here. It's all so supremely confusing, no?

'the extent to which we are encouraged to manipulate our environment is startling, yes?
treat a human being like a piece of furniture and it's much easier to get them to do what you want, especially if they haven't any sense to realise your act of manipulation goes directly against their best interests, only in favour of your own selfish wants, 'exploit to your hearts content', says the unwitting shepherd. therefore if you want something selfishly, and a human gets in the way, you could acknowledge their unique individuality and reach for the bridges of common ground, however that would take an awfully long time and nature knows nothing of time, so naturally it opts for the path of least resistance i.e. objectification. this leads to having power over one's external environment and thus protecting the internal environment and that all too precious ego, the more precious it is, the more it wants. and the ring it carries grants a special transition. desperately hungering for an escape from its own horror.'

We cannot evade our tribalism and as such we therefore require sophisticated tribalism. A projected, make-believe tribalism so that when our team loses, we don't piss and moan to the point of ripping each other's face off.

There's a nest here and I don't want to disturb it. I've been around long enough to realise the steps I must avoid, the words I cannot say, the looks I cannot give. It is this very mindset that has afforded me such a long stay. Every day grows longer and the habits bite deeper. There's a nest here and we mustn't disturb it. The hair, the skin, the smell, the shame. In the pit of my stomach the darkest secret sleeps. The colour in these paper walls fades like the setting sun, revealing stars in the dark. Are they the things to worship? That which can sparkle in the night? What secrets do you have to tell? Mirror, reflect, teach me to instruct myself, off of frightened bridges, over onto hurt people that drown in the shallow sea, blood from the eyes wetting me. The very same eyes that look down and see thousands of dirty mirrors, all cut up like deadly rocks. Shame. What a thing, to die so young. See that nest there? Don't disturb it.

Now that's vague and problematic.
A mindlessness of stimulating simulated loops.
A simulation? A dream of witless fantasy? Only one way to get there, across a bridge, with a friend.

Dear reader, did you receive the email...

The Landlord will need the code to his dream safe if he is to have a pleasant vacation. Her temperament leans on his ability to impress with clean halls and clean dreams. The outliers will have to be locked up for the time being within the safe. A space will need to be created for said safe to sit. He should be held in the lower levels of the Hotel. For the safe space to be of appropriate advantage it should be purged of all reflective surfaces. A safe space is fit for a safe when and only when the attitude of its internal environment can allow for no light to freely travel. The Landlord appreciates your continued efforts. As you were dear reader...

'Why should I expect to relish in the fruits of my labour if said labour happens to be of subpar quality? If I am unable to bear and produce the desirable situation, then I should be just as thoroughly unable to demand satisfaction from the behaviours of my eventual situations. If I fail, let them all fail likewise into my own indecisive delusion. I've trapped them succinctly in the womb of my evening.'

The pile of Infinite Food. An inexhaustible institution. Is always there for us to feed. Attitude is everything. Another cut, another burn, where will the fuse lead us to?

'A sham- A con-
Beware, bewa-, mirrors can lie'

You're talking to yourself again...

At the end of the day, if you don't have the songs, you don't have the songs. You're just some fancy prick in a cut up tee with a guitar strap hanging around his neck. A tree inside a garden with far too little room for all your so-called troubled leaves. You're only a small amount of stairs away from living as a child forever and on your death bed you shall come to witness all the life unlived in your youthful obsessions on the stairway to heaven.

Circles and Lines

Put down that fancy mouth of yours, boy, listen for once in your life. The mirrors on these walls and the steps in the walkways pass only once a millennium. Soak it up. You'll find milk and cookies in the dinning hall.

Sally and the Mouth

sitting up the tree

with looks upon their faces screaming
'BREATHE BREATHE BREATHE'

the man with the awfully sunken eyes

born from the ground with his sun-kissed face dribbling

all fell into a home of incoherency

now three live quite happily

drowning in the bluest of tea

You wind your way down the murky blue corridors, each step a thick sludgy mess drips from your feet. A shiny object falls into view, a light pink plum, you give it a little lick.

The dog broke her leg. 'In my mind, this has happened a thousand times'. Does she need the vet? 'She needs a doctor, sir.' Are you not a doctor? 'No mam, I am the vet.' Will she be better in time for the festivities? 'The festivities will have to be postponed indefinitely.' In my mind, this has happened a thousand times.

The dog is humping the dining table again, the terrible noise causes us all pain.

The Mask of Unreality

Well now isn't that a healthy fuck you, stretching on, one two skip a few ninety-nine 100!

Time for a break, time for a redefinition of our reality, time for a kit Kat. What we'll call reality will be as follows; 'the experience through some conscious interaction of the recordable recorded environments of both internal and external measures', we're going to jump into the sea with this as our shoddy little lifeboat of sin, sardines and scribbled seahorses. Wavy feedback loops that'll produce ever more complex death-avoiding instincts that push us away from the end towards life-power beginnings, held in the poisoned corrupt arms of knowledge and reason and wicked wisdom. Remove consciousness and you remove reality; Don't touch that! Remove reality and you have your nonexistence. Non-existence gives you the purest freedom and the most boring eventlessness. Back to the beginning we fall, down into the chaos of it all. Nothingness is a tricky place to sit for some, a non-place with not even a darkish non-dark darkness to light the negative positives and dullen the positive negatives. It's positively absurd. Have you heard it before? I'm sure you have by now. It isn't with or without, it is both & neither, rather simultaneously. It isn't anything, it isn't even nothing, an every-anything that cannot be discretely packaged, produced, articulated or experienced. Below the final floor, under the end of the underground rat halls where there are lost people dreaming of dead dying things that scream in their faces for a simply second to exist. To them it isn't even about greener grass, it's just about, it's jus-

Easy to talk in a loop when talking of the grandest greatest feedback of foreverness. We are like the dog chasing its own tail, simply infinite, round and round. 'Cats on the other hand don't chase their tails, they do however, tease themselves with yarn; if that isn't the most illuminating analogy for the difference between mood and food then burn a kiss and call it cathartic, I am not your milk maid, man. Even the word feminine has the word nine within it just as woman has man within, yet man (the word) sits on an island of his structured loneliness (the line of a page, with the many lone repetitions that it has). Only light he sees being the anima (inner feminine)'. Although speaking of words within words is a fool's errand so let's just fan the fire flat and move on. The men are the lines, the woman is the page, they are ants and she is their queen.

From Dorm to Diffa

Where is the room for choice in the natural order of all things existing, hall upon hall of dominoes falling into the backs of one another? who pushed me? who pushed them? you want your answer? go back to the beginning of it all. good luck finding it, good luck unravelling that thread to the point where a nothing meets an everything and of course you'll see them all there, in their graduated tragedy. all the king's men that couldn't put humpty back together again, so they raped their daughters and shot their wives. but if they took a postmodern step back and did the cha cha, they'd realise they never knew how or who was which one what Wednesday in the first place. because humpty had never been broken before, they never needed to be put together, they already came together and needed nothing. only after being broken did they need that which was never possible as it had never had a reason to be possible.
But I digress and care not to articulate my thoughts any clearer, tell me my punishment is swirling down this drain of mediocrity? i'll catch it and fuck it. and tell me my thoughtlessness is bland. tell me I don't belong. toss me to the alien pirate witches and robot wizards, they have me for a reconditioning appointment which I am so fervently looking forward to.

OF DEATH DREAMS AND FEEDBACK LOOPS FROM THE WAY BACK WHEN OF TOMORROW'S YESTERDAY.

he always wears black, he's obsessed with his face, the anti-social kind of chase.
a socially acceptable form of it lingers loud in some society today.
it finds its way into every nook and cranny.
you've seen it. you've heard its name.
it's so mundane, so run of the mill.
few find anything quite as grotesque.
that which he holds so close to his chest.
a failure he means to call his best.
blood loving protection like a newborn baby ill.
couldn't breathe without it.
hate breeds his social rape.
he's the socially able asocial trait.
even has his own cape.
he wears it on Sundays.
you've seen them, they all come to worship his skin.
his silent aggression lures you in.
you speak his name as he swears his sin.
curse his spell as we approach his hell.
hear how they scream his name!

as you lower your hand to touch yourself.

now you feel his pain.

as you run for help

you covet a power, a slice of heaven.

a morsel of his darkest energy.

of her finest hour.

a fool's enemy.

you'd just as soon die for it all.

but he doesn't care.

you wouldn't dare want him to notice.

for in her rebellion is your lust.

he's anti, you're plus.

eternal ignorant disgust,

her status, your symbol.

he's thumb, you're thimble.

long gone is the idyllic trust in the manufactured musk.

continue cutting their crust, past their puff pawned passionate crass-corn consumption.

you've harboured hate, sans function.

go watch in the mirror as he has her way.

he poisoned the water, you drank his spray.

she sold your freedom, you bought his slave

the game was rigged.

your soul was raped.

you hummed their lie.

you're gonna die now, not gonna wait

but your mouth's been taped.

shut and it's already far too late.

now it's time for another story.

you'll listen with your eyes

see your final one.

the sound of a barrel.

the taste of a gun.

bang!

lights out-

you're done.

Words of a Blind Rabbit

alone here, sitting, writing on a wintery Friday evening, again. tea beside my lap, leaning suspiciously on the sofa that is my bed. i don't know where this is going, i just felt like writing. my mind always seems to float adrift to the same old place of thought in times like these, alone in the house staring at the mirror. that familiar chair in my head always makes me think of the copious ways in which the world can lie to us. not with what it says or in what it does, but with what it doesn't say, and doesn't do. therein sleeps the lie, unconscious and ignorant. maybe i'm to blame. i'm not enough to think of, to... imagine, I guess. though maybe i'm too much to realise? too needy, too overbearing, too alien? but i suppose people change. i never change, why don't i change! why don't I change? maybe I have. maybe we all have and maybe it's better this way, what could better even hope to mean? is avoiding the pain, better? my tea is one third full, two thirds empty... I've never described myself as a pessimist (adolescence doesn't count) but I'm rolling my eyes far more than I used to. everything's gone to waste, colourless, tasteless. when the surprises cease to be surprising, everything tastes a little, meh; but I wouldn't jump as far as to describe this blip in time, this fleeting mood, a pessimistic train ride per se, it's just a mood. I guess I wouldn't describe it at all, unless you consider this slice of nonsense a description. even my tea is less than satisfactory, and I've forgotten everything else, but I think I still remember it. how it used to be at least. if times changed I wouldn't know, you don't come around here much these days, I get it, life's , when ? what is really?? is that some esoteric cue, dancing high above my head out of reach like the top shelf cookie jar? well if it is, would you kindly to the land of social ineptitude in which I reside or throw down a ladder so's I might have a chance in understanding this ridiculously complex, frustratingly upside down back to front game of tic-tac-toe we call communication ? my cup of tea is now finished and I still don't know what this all means. Charlotte said runny ice cream was always her favourite, now she's cobbling shoes in Idaho. And the spirits are phoning home, what how are they... doing? it really is a curse, being the elephant in this tiny room. even worse, believing you are not. I can hear that big dog humping again...

'Now all that's out of the way, come with me now on a marvellous journey, of life and death, of great tall big things and tiny little short things, of nice things and bad things. We'll travel through forests metaphysical, serene in solitude and ghastly profound in magnitude. We'll be sure to stop off at a servo here and there to stock up on some marbles and a healthy helping of home brew Sarsaparilla. Probably see a few wolves on their bellies, might even catch a fish or two for ourselves. We'll float our way home when the time comes. We'll have fun no doubt, though things may turn sour sometimes, hell we might even find ourselves lo- come with me now on a marvellous journey, of li-come with me now on a marvellous journey, of li-come with me now on a marvellous journey, of li-come with me now on a marvellous journey, of li-come with me now on a marvellous journey, of li-

Timelessness

Sally says,

To view any section of infinity is to see yourself reflected back at you...
nature is- perfect, you are not, we communicate with perfection to see ourselves and the potential within its infinity. like the image of a pink dolphin swimming in neon green lakes of fire, big shimmering golden lights blasting through you like knives of creativity. You burn another kiss. And in its flame, we feel the coldest warm, a lonely pulse of light, breathing in the cupboard together, losing themselves together.

now of course, this has no bearing on the real world...

whatever it is, it cannot happen without the energy, the buzz, the beginning of the event. but we aren't the ones that decide if that energy is around when we need it. It comes from the people we meet, and we don't choose who enters our lives and become a part of our journey. though we live in a society whereby you must 'earn' what you desire. yet we don't control if this buzz, energy, whatever you want to call it, occurs; since that is what needs to occur in order to make things happen, what do we really earn? for some it happens, for others it doesn't, why does it happen for anyone at all? is it really all random? in order for the ball to be freed, the glass must be filled up until it is overflowing. we delude ourselves into believing we control the water, we do not. at least not in the 'free willing' way we originally thought. some glasses never get full, some are never free. do they deserve their drought? what did they do wrong? with some lives we can clearly see the faults but in others it's murky water. opposites while frustrating and almost always in the way, lead us to clarity and important perspectives we otherwise would have overlooked which take us right back to confusion and the complexity consumes us. Belts and Spoons, baby, belts and spoons. Attraction is magnetic. Aesthetic is the electromagnetic field keeping the soup all together, an interface for perception, a Seaford Meadows.

Outside immediate perception, aesthetic is brewing, readying the advertisement.

Let's fashion an imaginary world to explore this idea more...

With the meeting of our next character, Mako. A distant relative of some ancient friend. Fond of the treehouse and welcome anytime. A surfer from the south with a knack for fishing and almost certainly wiser than the Wazoo.

heartfelt vs heartless

Mako believes in more than just magic marbles such as fridges and fruit salad, let's hear their story.

Once upon a time there existed a world inhabited by two kinds of people, the heartfelt and the heartless. surprisingly, despite being complete opposites they seemed to live in peace and harmony in their world for rather pleasing lengths of time. unfortunately, there was always a small section on each side that desired not just peace but a total oneness of their own kind. inevitably this led to a flux from peace to war every three decades. a shifting of forces back and forth tearing at each side. this led to an unprecedented event whereby...
the world split into two timelines. in one timeline the heartfelt people succeeded in converting all the heartless people into heartfelt, all was one. but a big problem came along. A terrifying heart eating dragon appeared; threatening to destroy the entire world if none of the heartfelt people could carve out the tongue of the magical yeti that lived high up in the mountain. yet none of the heartfelt people were able to perform such a cruel deed and the dragon consumed all the people and their world disintegrated. over in the other timeline, a similar problem came along. the heartless people were successful in extinguishing all the heartfelt people, all was one. but the heartless people didn't foresee the darkness that would soon befall them. one frosty night, a wise old fluffy rabbit hopped its way into town warning of a terrible flood approaching. the overwhelming cuteness of the rabbit was undeniably repulsive to the heartless and made them all feel weak and insecure with emotion. thus it was slain instantly by the townsfolk. eventually the flood came and washed all the heartless people away and their world disintegrated.

so in both worlds we see that the heartfelt and heartless needed each other but were not able to relate their differences and ultimately all perished as a result.

You need your opposites. What is opposite to a human? Everything the human perceives. It is the storyteller of contradiction.

another story.

Imagine if you lived in a town that exclusively sold strawberry ice cream, but you only liked vanilla ice cream. You wouldn't be very satisfied with wanting what you want where you were wanting it, would you, hmmm? you would have, as one may see it, three main options.

    move to a town that sold vanilla ice cream

    convince the town to start selling vanilla ice cream

    change what you want

technically you could invent your own vanilla recipe but let's ignore that and any other creative possibility you might imagine just to poke holes in my story...

however, the third option is what is most intriguing to me. it introduces the idea of considering what you* want* to want, not just what you presently want. what is the most desirable want and thus the want that you would want to want to want possession of*?* For it to be the most beneficial want for your needs, whatever that means. Well in the case of this story, what you want is vanilla ice cream but what you want to want is strawberry ice cream (because this would make life easier, according to the majority trend setters... those that enjoy strawberry, have decided that strawberry is the thing to enjoy) but you don't want to want to want it; because you want what you want and you see no reasonable reason to recondition yourself, just to fit in, you lack the motivation. because it's just ice cream, it isn't that important...

Change the want you want to want to have to need what you want to have to need...

what we have to make absolutely clear is that in the real world, there's nothing that you could want that isn't connected to another human being. you are not making decisions purely for yourself by yourself on your lonesome, Jones. everything you can consider has within it the consideration of those around you, Jonny. No matter how individualistic you may perceive yourself to be, you are not alone. you can never be alone unless you are dead. which means a desire to be alone forever is equally a desire to be a dead thing, a done thing. only the dead and the dying wish for such a foolish nothingness inside themselves; what a terrible trap of quicksand.

you could easily be satisfied with just putting up with the strawberry ice cream for the sake of appearances; for the sake of fitting in. what if though, deep down you are vehemently against the consumption of such ice cream and simply and straightforwardly yearn for plain vanilla? assuming that vanilla was never coming to town you would either have to change what you want or go without ice cream. but how does one change their want, change their belief, change anything at all? Hmm, bit by bit I suppose. And those silly insufferable strawberry fanatics convince themselves of their superiority purely from the point of their vanity, that is their blind subjectivity.

'i like the fact that i think this is worthy of writing down. Ha Ha Ha.'

Don't look at my walls, I haven't had a good day, I feel bare, revealing empty hollowness.
It's like looking at the sunset and feeling nothing, eating ice cream and tasting dust, touching fire and feeling nothing but the cold.

Shark is to wolf as fish is to sheep. And the frogs can't yet sleep.

The world has you jaded and by the balls, Sir Mako, too much expectation, too much risk to run the wicket, too much potential for- god knows what? Knowledge of the wanting has left you waiting overwhelmed and isolated. You yearn to make that which is powerful powerless in a fool's attempt at knowing stability. Simplicity for the sake of saving the world. A reduction of life's pain for soul sapping pleasure of fantasy, a mask to wear when you feel oh so ashamed of the dirt. like a blanket over the mess to shield your broken heart, a pulse you feel, as though it's just organic art. Don't deny yourself that spirit. We are here to help you; we can fix these Sally woes you wear to sleep. Remember.

3. Ideal superpositions form-fixed recognition

Transparency is a key aspect to becoming a successful citizen of the NVRM. Participation in transparency recognition activities (TRA) is nonoptional. Disattending TRA sessions will lead to recycling and further reconditioning. We embrace your cooperation with our loving arms. We can learn and grow together when we are open and willing to share our innermost happenings, this is the importance of transparency, there can be no surprises. As our wellness is intrinsically linked, your happiness is our happiness. We are so gratefully pleased that the opportunity to bring all citizens of the NVRM together as one is finally coming to fruition in a very real and consistent way.
TRA will consist of four primary stages. Firstly, a wellness introduction to evaluate your commitment to the Collective. Secondly, an openness collaboration where citizens will learn about utilising mnemonic strategies to create transparent moral identities. Thirdly, a stewardship advisory counselling designed to empower citizens with opportunities to create ad space where openness and transparency can flourish. Fourthly, a purpose-alignment verification to ensure mental wellbeing is true and maintaining vacancy for your dream vessel. TRA's will occur bimonthly commencing in by the waning of the next cycle. We can't wait to see your happy smiling faces in your clean compatible bodies. One Consciousness. One Condition.

The shadow of a ghostly being floods your mind like a dense fog, your head feels heavy. You hear a deep soft voice wandering with hurried intent. It speaks to you as warm water from an unknown source coats your naked body.

Shampoo and conditioner do not mix. Body wash is versatile. Showers are addictive.

The Purge of Responsibility

You think it mere shadow, as if you have only ever been animal. what rubbish, what a con of consciousness! The greatest story maker is that voice in your head! It's such a sham. You couldn't be simple if you tried - but I wouldn't dare stand by - in the breeze of your aftermath. You are an entire universe of emotion, flawed and full of feeling. you hurt, you love, you lie, you die, you cry, you try to trust; though you are destructive, you are truly awe inspiring. your single existence has more meaning than a solar system has matter, more room for love than skies have stars. you are not here to be forgotten, no, you are not here for simplicity or reduction, power or control, pleasure, distraction, isolation, escape.
You are here for each other. you are here for a discovery, not a lone in direction. You are here for the purpose of your invention not the pleasing of hopelessly circular moods and the consumption of fleeting foods. You are that which is impossible to define yet you owe it to this earth blood to seek beauty through its discovery and journey. like the sculptor takes beauty to the blocks of marble, the artist unto canvas. You are your castle of sand waiting & wanting to be found. Let's find it together, another beginning awaits us in the Nature of all things big & beautiful.

Some entities have a stimulation diet such that enough is never really enough. They're never satisfied in their stillness. They want too much.

they run at each other, like animals, will they ever meet? your guess is as good as mine...

*Godmother of the Eternal Blue ship in the dark sky of dreams throw down your elevator of sand and sea. Let us suckle at the milky nectar of your divine soul. We adore you. We will do anything for you. Queen of the feed let us taste your wisdom. Share your infinity. We are dissolving in the bleeding of your blood, dream for us, sweet dreamer.

*A record scrolls itself into place. The sound of music fills your room. It's a massive attack on your senses. A dissolved girl finds herself in your way. You listen to her whine. You begin to snap your fingers to the beat. The milk turns black.
*

You're gone. Now why the hell should anyone care about what you've done? You shot the pain into the alleyway and flew into the wall. Why should anyone care where you've run off too? Don't you realise the truth was never under the bed. Stop searching. Let go! You never had to go chasing so far. You only realised it too late, you're in the branch of some rotten tree wondering where the new end will take you. Trouble is that the point of pain is to feel something realer than the real you've gotten used to. Reality is a mix of the most insane drama and pointless construction. Dark metallic blood, every other stain imaginable. Poison through your veins. Don't worry. Let it go. It's all you know is all you need. It's a candle, an apple and a needle. You want to take it all but still you're the fool for not realising you've been here all along. The same old place. The same stupid memory. Taking you back and forth between mirror and marble, prismatic teardrop. Get in your cage. Rat. Get in our head about all the decay of the physical hallway wallways in your cluttered mind. What's a wallway? It's like a room made out of floors. Charisma is everything. We're so energised by our need to align ourselves with some infinity to avoid death all together that we are in a constant desperation brought on by our existential dread. The weight of it all fills us with terrific determination to reproduce all that we have and align our offspring toward infinity so that we can live on forever. Even after our departure our genetic information propagates.

Before we go any further, let's review our to-do list:

    Burn train ticket

    Stare at bottle of wine

    Study handshaking

    Music review

Chapter Seventy-Two

A collection of thoughts from Library 27

The Nature of all things Big & Beautiful, let them Gab as good dreamers do.

Your What Went Which Way?

Episode One, Trip #1

Dear reader, we uphold a strange belief. Wherein here by and now fully stated, thy and by, may the better entity of BIGNESS have wineth its victory. However, the definition of 'better' is like shapeshifter, it is a fluid chameleon, 'monkey see monkey do'. In other words, it is not to be trusted. We believed, for most of the time, that better means most skilful, most talented, most able, most fancy. More and more however, as our awareness increases, we realise so-called "better" seems to mean something closer to a social competency, manoeuvrability, social prowess, status, idealness. A social meritocracy over a competence meritocracy. After all, these are the wake walking talking's of social creaturatus. It is necessary, then, to, as much as possible, update one's social understanding so that it aligns with what is actually being defined by the observable natural world. If we operate with ideas far too skewed, our perception of reality distorts to the point of sole psychosis. It's a sham. The most loneliest cage, with only a powerful jet of water to keep it warm. Even more problematic is the situation in which humans are collectively psychotic to the point where icky sociopathic traits become desirable, even championed, we call these worshipped shams. It's a nasty feedback loop, the whole thick pot of nature's stew, brews the hotellian landscape of a soon-to-be god, the universal Father. A mechanism of the Godhood is the eating of itself, the devouring of the Son. Everything has been folding back in on itself, eventually consuming itself, becoming everything smaller, rinse and repeat. Just because a society collectively worships a mound of dirt, doesn't make dirt any less dirty. And we despise dirt. And this society of confused oily mirrors can absolutely worship dirt and have done and continue to do so. Before we begin, let's begin with a room. No door handles, no red telephone waiting rooms, just four grey walls and a window. Never trust the landlord, not even your own...

Let there be a portal on the floor in one corner of the room and a portal on the ceiling at the other end of the room. Going through the floor portal would most assuredly take you to the other side of the room, assuming the portals are connected. You would drop through and land on the other side, got it? Now imagine this portal on the ceiling inching towards the centre of the room. As long as the ceiling portal is not directly over the floor portal, you will hit some ground, let's call this situation 'loop distortion' (because there's no 1:1 contact, the loop isn't closed, so there is an agreed upon beginning and end, start here - stop there). If a feedback loop (mirrors, portals, bridges, eyes, consciousness, waves, etc.) is distorted it will have a ground, a point at which it ends and resets, like the corner of a square. If, however, the two portals are directly over each other, they are in alignment, achieving zero distortion, like a circle (a shape absent of corners). This cancels out the discernible beginnings and endings of detectable corners and now you have yourself a roundabout. The whole system then becomes an infinite loop, constantly eating itself and spitting itself out again, over and over, reflections reflecting reflections, in a state of happening. You are in a forever-fall, a circle spiral fall, a wavy-wave fall. Is this the happening of consciousness? Is this playground of reality? Is this an aesthetic interface capable of transcribing stories? In the case of n-distortion (where n is some positive non-zero number) there is a clear event that takes place (a shape with some amount of corners, each corner a happened-event instead of a *happening-*event). You go in, you come out, and you stop some distance n away from your initial position. It happened. Well, it didn't, when you have infinity. In the case of zero distortion thus infinite clarity, there is no, "it happened", it is always "happening" and also not "happening", like death. Everything in between though? That happened at one point or another. Let's continue our falling thought. Falling only feels like falling when you have scenery to see it rushing by, tools to sense-make with. If you have no point of reference, eventually falling is just a being, 'existing'. It just is. You just are, in the boredom of it all. There is no Was Or Will only experience. Our universe seemingly cannot sustain this type of infinity, at least not in any capacity that we can currently perceive even with our advanced scientific instruments. Where art thou infinity? With each instance of the repetition there would have to be some distortion for it to be recordable, there's got to be an end to the madness of it all, surely. Imagine the subject falling infinitely through the portals with a slight difference at each instantaneous point in time, each snapshot a different hue, each instance of the being an alteration, a mutation; now the distortion is not in the beginning and ending of the event but of the subject, experiencing the event. The falling entity is the thing that is being distorted, the subject is the infinity, the human is the universe reflected. A real-world example of this is in the feedback loop of two mirrors pointed at one another. If you stand in between them and hold your arm up, you will see yourself repeating off into infinity, but each instance of your arm will be slightly distorted and actually become greener in colour. Because a mirror doesn't reflect everything it receives, the proverbial portals are not lined up precisely, thus we have our distortion, we have an end to our infinity. Maybe it's impossible in our universe to have zero distortion, to have infinity and go on forever eating itself. It certainly seems that way given the laws of thermodynamics, energy must be conserved. There was nothing until those two mirrors were perfectly pointed directly at each other like soul mates.
'What are you watching?' Finding Nemo, Buzz Lightyear...
But then where does that leave consciousness? Could it be that the portals align, giving us consciousness, but conserves energy by distorting what it receives? Just as the mirror reflects slightly different light as some information is absorbed, consciousness reflects a slightly distorted perception, a slightly altered reality after absorbing the initial reflection? Seen through the window that is not yet a mirror, there is both a subtle reflection of the observer and a place beyond reflection, a place where the observer could be. This is fantasy, this is a dream you are dreaming. Humans are not what they say, they are what they do. What do you do? What will you do? Who will you meet and what reflections will you propagate through existence? Nature has not the patience for humility. The town has decided to commence production of a superb variety of ice cream flavours as the expansion of the new developments has allowed for such suburban additions.

Meet, Kreese & Fold, two dim witted blanket-faced fools, one large, one tiny. Side by side inseparable. Owners of all the hotel's red telephones, at least in their minds they are. Really thick and transparent, black with the seams showing. Inside-out and back-to-front, you name it, they had it. It was predictable, the way they liked ugly things. Everything and anything to move themselves away into something they considered 'real'. It had to be that way, their way. It's an extraordinary thing, married crows with shiny things. Red ribbons and dumb things, always wanting other things. Wonky things. Out of place things. The whole scene was there for that very reason, movie scenes for dirty tropes, hot and sweaty, wet and sticky. Oily, pulsating, up and down rooms, far away moans, back alley bottle business. What a secret it was. What a funny thing to want to wear. All day in the dirt and muck, like a pig in the mud. Relishing in the mess of it all. The all-consuming fate.

Mood is everything, pure and simple. The moving of feeling from one behaviour to the next. Another step, another room, another thought to manifest.

Tick, tock, tick, tick, eight past room 382, a red telephone hanging off the hook with the sound of a voice emanating from its bird cage...

"If you hit the finish line inside your head before your body does, you'll be a nihilist no question, and then you'll be in trouble! Mr Tsitra, your dry-cleaning is finished as usual, sir. Not a moment too soon, my dear. Please pick up the phone, Mr Tsitra. Did I ever tell you the one about the boy who cried wolf? Mr Tsitra, are you there sir? Macs, Hello?"

If you're curious about your whereabouts, just ask for Skwing Puzalus, he'll show you, he'll show you who you really are.

You slip down a purple-green passageway to find yourself in a cemetery greenhouse, lines of reminiscent perfumes rub against your face. A glowing tombstone in the middle of the room reads, "I vow to produce only the most wholesome brew of dream juice for the feed collective in accordance with Mother Blue Eternal's Great Wish. One Consciousness. One Condition." With a plaque beneath it commemorating the anniversary of the first soul to commit a sacrifice during the mass transportation event known as 'The Bleeding of the Feed'. There were seven such events before the NVRM dissolved. The room stretches for miles; you spot a mirror far off in the distance, it calls out to you and you begin to feel the floor becoming sand, Woosh! down you go...

Leviticus Sternwall, a teacher from the Old Primary. A callous woman, shrill and uptight. She never married and always wore a fiercely tight green pant suit with golden buttons. Short blonde hair as spiky as her personality. The children hated her, and she hated them. Her voice was like an electric shock to the innocent nervous system of the terrified school kids. Books would fly and shelves would rattle. Impossibly impatient and unable to be impressed. Never happy, never sad, only every angry. Angry at the world. Angry at life. Angry at the way she was and the way those around her were. Why's the world so noisy with their happiness? She'd often wonder. A thought like that consistently peppered throughout life leaves a stain on the face. A crinkled-up twisting of folded skin; all crumpled and creased with pain and disdain dripping like sweat from her forever furrowed brow. A crooked way about her movements always accompanied her strict robotic orders. She was a symphony of disaster. A ticking time-bomb at the top of a mountain of childhood repression. A shrew, calculated, entitled, overbearing wreck of a women.

Whatever scrap of innocence a child had left was beaten to a pulp and hung out to dry on

As the Individual of a Doo-Doo-opoly

People often say, "treat others how you wish to be treated", the golden rule ala 'mendus incomprehendus'. This is of course clumsy and frankly poisonous advice. Sugar for sweet toothed sharks. As far as we can surmise it needs alteration, recontextualising, reconditioning. Especially in the age of a rapidly evolving individualism. People don't want to be treated how you want to be treated; they want to be treated how they want to be treated. Now if everyone was the same, the golden rule would be perfectly sound advice. But they aren't all the same, far from it, and the zebras transform into seahorses more and more every moment. Maybe this rule once sought to push them all in that direction, of all becoming the same, so things ran smoothly. Till it all ran a little too smooth. However, maybe they don't need to all be the same for things to run smooth, in rough-smooth duopoly, a smooth enough reality. Food and Mood that chew on each other to get by. Maybe we just need sharp tools of communication and social order. New technology is moving in a direction, not to advance our social instinct but actually to break it down completely. Is this to weaken and prepare for AI integration? Your guess is as good as any. Pressing on though, we've established that one wishes to be treated how they want to be treated as they see themselves not how you want to be treated as you see yourself. These may turn out to be the same page coincidentally on occasion, but in the times that they are not, is the unnerving birthplace of argument, or a transgression, or even a disconnection. Truly, people want to be treated as the individuals they are, which depends on their ability to communicate said individuality, which depends on their understanding of themselves. Their understanding of themselves depends on another's ability to reflect what has been communicated, as they see themselves reflected back at them. So on and so forth, the reflections and projections bounce between the mirrors that humans are. What a mess it creates, a beautiful mess of complications and misunderstandings. To begin a communication, one advances with their assumptions in response to the given stimuli. Hair colour, facial structure, body weight, etc. Human beings package these assumptions into mental organisations called stereotypes. These originate as judgements (cultural and metaphysical) to fill in the blank spaces of the incredibly complex individuality of a new unknown human, i.e. stranger. And like many of the human social processes, stereotyping is a wildly ineffective blunt tool. These preconceptions act as temporary bridges of communication upon which conversational tropes travel across as cautionary probes inspecting the new individual. One approaches a stranger with their assumptions about their character and treats the individual accordingly. A particular item of clothing may indicate an interest; alerting the individual to a possible avenue of discussion. When a disagreement occurs, the assumed individuality clashes with the actual individuality of the individual. If one accepts this, resolves it and adjusts accordingly their treatment of the future individual, the individuals will reach common ground. Deepening their mutual understanding of one another. This is the basis of the concept known as friendship. Whether or not it is to bud into a rich flower is dependent on the surrounding chemistry and the potential thereof. Many modern friendships seemingly lack this disagreement/discovery dynamic and as a result remain shallow and transactional, a friendship limbo if you will. Which is accepted unconsciously, not every connection needs to be a deep, soulfully stimulating endeavour. Though humans shouldn't shy away from potential disagreements for fear of offending or disturbing the peace. By the same token one should develop the wisdom required to decide the appropriate course of action for a given social situation. Only through sheer trial & error, and empathetic reserve will this come to be known, free will. The pressure you feel is growth absurdum, for truly how big can history class get before it all turns to mush?

But who am I, just another wanderer of these open halls, best be on your way...

The artificial intelligence of the 22^nd^ Century runs on premium pure-grade human imagination!! Unstoppable, high octane daydreams and fantasies! Their minds lead the way of the future and that sticky icky stuff they call Pink Tuesday. We can't get enough! It's soft and fluffy and gets in all the good places. Big beautiful bubbles it sure does create.

Are we really doing this? He said from the waist down. We have buttons and zips, but all the stores are closed. Whenever I put my socks on I always manage to grab the same sock for the same foot of the previous time the pair was worn. And so our water bottles need refilling often for our parched passions are in debt to so much foul fuel. This is unconscious and done without prior concern, in most cases. I don't know why it happens the way it happens, it just does; did, done, though still not ever over, you know? But that's another game people frequently play, card after card, magic is more than spiritual. But it should interest you to know that not many folksy folks are here been having said the very same things you've been saying. Let's say them more again. I don't want to leave just yet.

Empty Words and Troubled Verbs

We are so far removed from the animal kingdom that we are no longer looking at a reality. Engulfed by fantasy, our heads lay in the guillotine of delusion, the blade of which is a childhood dream falling to severe us from our body. Snap snap! Goes the creaky wind tunnel. Unwound, unbound, turned to the spirits we will be. Isolated from that which we knew to be real yet rejected every bloody chance we got, like fools we sang songs of reverie to ourselves only ever about ourselves of our own damn lives to our strangled overused mirrors that don't care, can't care, had no reason to care. Too eager down this happy trail we've laughed our heads off now. Blind to the sickness we were dramatic with, caught in a fever dream. Emotions caused us more pain, regret and suffering till we were ever so dull, too dull to feel them, so we discarded them. Flaws caused embarrassment and shame, so we covered them. Sincerity caused cringey vulnerability, so we fashioned a mask to hide from our shadow, nay! We fashioned a knife and threw it at the backs of our newly born free-spirited kin, the ones we had the greatest wishes for. We betrayed our souls; we ran from our dreams. We tarnished child-like wonder with abusive maneuverers learned too quick. This is merely a detailing not a critique, nature tells the stories we need to hear in the only pattern that can be heard, the dominos of survival, the glue of dust. The first time we discovered our reflection it terrified our inner shy-soul softness to such an extent that we fell into the fall we are still in, to this day, falling in. We reflected the knowledge of our mortality through ourselves and thus split our consciousness in two, two light pink plums. Rapidly, our awareness grew, as did our soon-to-be famous arrogance, Fragrance Millionaire. We no longer feared death, we had mastered it, we were rich. With our subconscious now absorbing the brunt of our death-dream anxiety we were able to trick ourselves into our great fantasy. A fantasy of godlike proportion. The fantasy of delighted fools, the fantasy of the freest will. Oh hey greatly we paid for its price. The tale of freedom from nature, this accidental privilege granted us the ability to be absorbed in a false reality, a nightmare made physical; that consequently, truly we then believed ourselves to be kings of ourselves, exactly. Experts of the self. Deciders, decision makers, even over own nature? The very thing that guides all things. Rulers of imagination, fragmented figments of infallibility, we saw ourselves above it all. A nature above & beyond nature itself? A feedback out of control! Feeding upon itself. Eating. Consuming. Destroying. Renewing. There's been no greater natural sleight-of-hand than the belief that humans live in a human world, for humans, by humans, a private universal playground for the pathetic critters to crawl around in. No greater sin exists than to truly view oneself as the centre, beginning, the be all and end all of the universe and we do it with such ease, we think it's reasonable to be so self-enthralled. Though, is it not the case that consciousness and the ability to discover better modes of being, grant human beings a special kind of significance within the universe? Maybe they are special. A seriously profound responsibility they carry, to manifest the greatest good manageable simply because they have the very specific potential to do just that, is this not true? Maybe the arrogance isn't so unfounded after all. Heart surgery, moon landings, Wi-Fi enabled toasters, rechargeable thumbs, etc. Whether or not humans are a net good on their environment is a deepening point of contention. But the least that can be said is by golly gosh... they sure are extreme in every direction. Be it withstanding horrific tragedy or yearning the warmth of a loved one, from strength to strength in spite of all flaw and weakness, the human spirit is well worth keeping intact. Though I'm just an old man in a rocking chair with a room full of mirrors, do you like the smell of burning flesh?

Here Charlotte, this is all they had, sure beats vanilla. How come everything out here is so dusty? Did you see that fella coming outta servo just then? Blowing down the alley in his big dusty clothes half falling off his bones. Kinda reminds me of back home. The way the wind would blow those droopy trees into all sorts of contorted shapes. Rain always brings that familiar feeling with it wherever you go I s'pose. Same smell. Same mood. I reckon nostalgia is the most puzzling buzz a person has. I used to get it from the music. Or the taste of beer. Hit ya like a row of dominos. We'd build cubbies till sundown. We could do it all again if we wanted to, Charlotte. Just push that button and, boom, eyes shut, lights out, not a thing to worry about. Isn't that what they say? Don't they tell of the most blissful experience? I know their eyes do. Better than the dust out here, anything's better than the dust out here.

*Honour, Respect, Compliance

*All citizens return to their quarters.

The Story of It

If all the fish in the pond swam as self-proclaimed gurus of the sea, they'd all die from lack of audience.

Are you in on the joke yet? Postmodern boyo, all bouncy 'n' bubbly like. 'You are what you eat', you will become that which tastes good to you! You will not decide what your taste will become, you will not choose what you are attracted to. It is a pre-coded instinct, a feeling, mood, a way for your environment to speak through you aesthetically projected. A journey of destiny, you are here being forced upon, you just don't realise. Its hunger is your hunger. Her needs are your needs, bow to the Queen of All. Its will is your command, deny it and you will become torn asunder, do as we say. Elevate yourself. Accept it and a fleeting fashionable trend will be enough to do you in. Consume you completely! Nature has made you into a puppet, anti-intellectual freedom fighters would have you believe the so called "Elite" are the cancerous shepherds to the sheep, though even the slave masters have their masters, not as we do. All are sheep in chains of Nature's prison walls, incarcerated by a will to power, barbed wired and bellied up, mere reflections in mind. We are food for thought ready for slaughter. Does God cook his Fiiiiish? Think of all the things that could happen, and from it all realise, only one thing actually ends up happening, an infinity all at once. Imagine reaching the end of the universe, turning around and asking yourself, "What happened?". What an impossible question to answer, it would depend on the accuracy of your teeny scope. You might as well say, in a very general sense, "it" happened, but what is "it"? 'The big infinite air?' Is it a what? A when? Is it, imagination? What is what? What could what be? Who could what when? Are you what then? Did you happen, are you it? Is your life a happening? How would one go about unpacking the box of it? Let's have a crack at it; 'Trillions and trillions of tiny little particle things all bashed into each other in a variety of speeds?' How long would it take to accurately detail, in writing, an entire history of the universe? Probably the time it takes to live it plus the time it takes to write it all down plus the time it takes to think of what to write down, how to write it, etc. That's at least three times the size of the original, that's a lot of it. You'd need a whole two more universes to get it all done. And by then you'd have two more universes to detail which would require another four universes, each needing two universes to detail the new details, totalling eight additional universes (you see the exponential nature?). You'd never get anything done unless you planned on doing it forever. Or, you could save time by making each reiteration identical. Hmm, now you're getting somewhere...

An identical universe, written, recorded and repeated? Forever the same? Where?

The wolf said unto his captured tribe of sheep and shepherd,

'Repeat after me, "I cannot judge... the actions of a wolf... as I am not... in the body of a wolf", again, and again'.

With their phones to their faces they sang and danced around the fire till morning, they still had no clue what a pillow was for. Come morning time, the fittest personality won the prize, the personality of a God had been discovered and now they knew the purpose of a pillow.

SCIENTIFIC RESOLUTION: THE PERSONALITY OF A GOD

Learning how to lie in a pretty boring, repetitive dystopia, by anybody's standards.

Find a pleasant enough hole, smoke whatever's in arms reach and bury yourself in the hunky-dory of it all, cos this shit ain't easin' up anytime soon. Balls to the walls, bro!

1984, Myra wasn't really a fool, he just kind of pretended to be one, maybe that made him a fool's fool, maybe that made him honest, earnest, naïve. Brain rot. Cancer got rich. Fame rules this world! Idolisation-desire, icons & stardom. Obsession! Secession in session. Big promises of eternal pleasure-balloons full'o Air. Subsiding in the minds of the Sleepwalkers, the Liars, cheaters, jokers and thieves. A gaseous haze; storming like the atmosphere of Jupiter. That was the attitude of the populace of this forsaken land. Stumble through a cobweb, twirl like a madman, open the door to room 85, watch out for the snakes and ladders.

Sally says,

The body of an adult with a child at the helm requires psychological development, though if a child is the one making the decisions, this development will surely go poorly awry. Their refusal to grow up, inability to see within themselves for what they truly are will be their undoing, but not without a fight for all the power in the candy shop. They can't go on with their sorry lives after witnessing the Pink Elephant. So, grab your friends, load up on guns, cry in corruption, cos you've just had social immunity afforded to you by your own selfhood expertise. But in the end, it doesn't even matter. Nature doesn't care about all that, about what you say child. The minutia of the human's day to day, is so irrelevant for dreaming. Nature cares for one outcome; can you tell a good story? That's it. Can you persuade the external entities that the words you speak are worthy of following, worthy of worship? Naturally, your words lead to informational propagation. Your story is in your genetic code, is it told convincingly? DNA. Does it? R&R. disperse within the pool like a cloud of piss? Is it a successful meme? A funny, Ha Ha!? Hard On Relaxing in the warm water of the soapy spa. Relatability is comfortability. Truth hits home for humans, it's the way they're bred. The letters you've sent have all been returned to you. The hole in your face is pouring out. The robots are making their favourite noise again. Bzzzzzzzzz. No one's at the door to answer for, whatever shall we do? Pass the responsibility back, pong for another ping. Those plush white robes are hand-me-down elitesssssss. Slither. Where have all the adults gohne?

Why do you assume that if the answer to your question was knowable, that it would be popular enough for you to come across it? What has you so convinced that the truth is what you truly want, or what anyone actually seeks, long after its invention? Is that really what you seek? Mr Liar. They seek that which gives them power over their environment, control to manipulate and perform. Whether or not that happens to be truth or fantasy is of no concern to the seeker, dreamer, cheater. You might say a scientist seeks knowledge, though, knowledge need not be true, only need be temporarily not false. A working model. A scientist seeks methods of accurate physical natural manipulation, models of these methods to structure and compile the current successes are the scientist's bread and butter. The power of the scientist is in their ability to detach oneself from their emotional connection to a failing model and replace it with a working one, regardless of the passion. This allows the scientist to forgo human irrationality elevating oneself beyond the flaws of the human condition. A powerful yet delusional wagon to flex upon. Mistaking the patterns of the universe for a consistent rule and fighting over said rule is a war waged by humans for all of their existence. The rational man is made from irrational fool into trickster. Given that now he hides his foolishness from his rationality. Tricking himself into believing he has conquered himself and thus in a position to conquer all of nature. The only lid for such a fool is an even bigger delusion... The intellect of the enlightenment called for a tripling of the weight of previous fantasies. But as it were, the time for fantasies was through. Humans revealed to themselves that they themselves were the story makers. They were the source of their own dogma. Took a look behind that curtain and saw no wizard of oz, they found only a mirror. You read books to discover what you had not known before, as they were written by people that are not you. The book kind of turns stale if you uncover the author to be yourself, suddenly you remember the ending, and everything loses meaning. You feel let down, betrayed, depressed? Without purpose, because you were expecting to be told something new, some new kind of revelation that would lead to an even deeper meaning. But all you felt was foolishness in the reflection of that mirror, shame, embarrassment, a jaded temperament. This is the curse of enlightenment. The inevitable growing pains that followed truly left the world smouldering in a bitter wasteland, poisoned in greyscale, with nothing but cheap tropical dreams to plaster over the walls. Dollar tree wallpaper propaganda. Welcome to your new utopia, hope you like the smell of decay and decadence. Mount Corruption just received its latest upgrade, exemption from accountability, its free reign baby, don't look back now, you'll only scare the kids. SALLY

So, the treehouse is a place of confusion? If so high up in the clouds, is it also a place of clarity? A haven? A there wherein which those that are lost in their own minds can come to find answers or atleast pause the questioning??

The 'What If' paradox

The handyman that laid the brickwork for the road into dystopia was our oldest companion, language. Its capacity to bend and twist the environment altered minds, building them into monuments and cut them down like trees. Language was at the heart of it all. Language made spirits physical, idea into reality, the unknown known. A seriously powerful weapon. Humans stood no chance. For millennia language had evolved from instinctual curses to complex rituals, simple commands to impenetrable manipulations of mystic minds. The lie became a thing of worship. When pencil became pen, going back lead nowhere. When giving up is not an option, a lie becomes a cons best friend. Persuasion, the soul of a lie, making that which cannot be, be... It's no wonder why, a fragile collection of creatures came to be so in love with the production of such sinister dogma, as it had brought them such wonderful gifts from the beyond. Why have truth when you can party a lie? And party they did, with the god of wine that made sure of it. No ifs ands or buts. They live in the if world and never make it to the is world. Always imagining, always floating trips down a meadow or stream of cloud-filled fantasies. Stuck dreaming in the forever shower, hands so wrinkled the bone is suffocating. They give old Peter Pan a run for his money, the Oompa Loompa's know their anguish. Everyone's mad at existence. So much time spent consuming lies they've become inundated with infatuation. They can only lie their way through the murky.

Finding the middle.

Lies are senseless without a goal, such as a piece of furniture to objectify, a roadblock to manoeuvre, a pothole to cover up. The ritualistic lies practiced by a people tells us a society's trajectory. Lies of fame and fortune? Valour and superstition? These sound like the hallmark calling cards of an academy fit for fostering animals into Gods, souls into bots! They beckon only the throws of the restless under blankets. Amoeba into Artificial incomprehensible Intelligence irrefutably disinterested. Remember the pinging ping pong of nature? The tennis court of confusions, vast and plenty? From hivemind to individual back into hivemind then, hmm? Ping. Pong. A game of tennis played above our heads, we wondered if we'd ever see ourselves again or was it all in the hands of the sky beasts? But the warmth of the human spirit is undeniable, no? Well, it is unless too many roadblocks & potholes begin to riddle the landscape, leaving the road far too congested for any connection to occur. And so the people turned away from each other. Rendering any feeling at all, a moot endeavour, a questionable affair, a rush of overwhelming anxiety. Thus, began the seemingly unending descent into maddening separation. Once feeling became unnecessary baggage, like the unused muscle, they atrophy. The foolishly rational groups equipped reason and buried emotion, viewing it as a violation, a filthy rat in their pristine house of perfection, immediately requiring extermination. Order. Control. Power. These are the masks worn by the self-conscious animal. A liar. A fool. A scared little soul confused. Quickly fashion a remedy, at once. SELLS

Angels and Scientists

You could murder someone, wait a week or two and still win a Nobel Peace Prize.

Feelings are not decisions, James, they are responses that influence decisions. Morality is what you can get away with. You could trick yourself into feeling like you have control over your decisions by deciding not to feel. Just kill god, murder the shepherd and become one. Or at least, ignore what you feel, Daniel. Denial is a funny way to go Frank, the age of the needlessly cynical Sons of Sam's reaching maturations of Stevie's, what a scary thing to see Alan. 'At least then I could say I knew. I could say I spent the time of my life and finally know for certain'. No, wait, really think about that phrase... the time of your life? "I had the time of my life", that phrase doesn't contain within itself anything necessarily positive. It's neutral. You had the time; it wasn't a good time, it wasn't a bad time, it was just time. That's all anything is, it was all just time spent, 'would you like your receipt with that?'. Any interaction is stimulating at the very least, in so far as you require some sort of sense to perceive the stimuli in perception. 'In the smallest sense, it was... something was there, something happened, it happened, and you were a part of it and now the moment is gone to history'.

To be a part of some kind of anything far outweighs any type of quietness you might imagine the eventual nothingness could offer. This is a road that excludes no traveller, no walk of life is free from this burden. All who experience the it of experience do so against cost of abject freedom (the freedom promised in death). None can change the swells of time, like tides it moves us, shapes our perception, our experience. Like a glove we fit to it, touching every wall, filling every hollow, breaking up inside ourselves to quench the thirst of our soul's design. Loving the hurt of it, forgiving the hate in it. The heartache, the headache, the wretched wreck of the unconscionable earthquake we've fallen into.

Honour, Respect, Compliance

Your room shows no life lived. It is a complete fabrication of status. A replication of an idea. A duplication of an aesthetic advertised to you. Aesthetic rules, yes, it is true, that sounds nice and if a dystopia is sufficiently pretty, we will gladly accept the invitation. Out of all potential aesthetic moods, the most alluring, the most powerful, is the aesthetic with the most members, the largest group is seen as most reproductively successful. The meaty part of the bell curve. Majority rules the rules, strength in numbers, no? Makers of sheep and zebra, seahorse and wolf. Mediocrity, while often under attack by the cynically pessimistic, is indeed warm to the touch of love. A friend of nostalgia, no doubt. Feelings of familiarity, of likeness, relatability, favourability, these are rather stimulating siblings. So, if averageness is so loving, why then do they not idolise it? Ah, but they do. They idolise the averageness seen in the members of the higher percentiles in their bell curve.

The relatable king, the charismatic queen, the superhero with an affinity for the common man, the maverick is what they marvel. The joker with a blue collar, the disaffected spark within the working class. A thread of mediocrity is seen dangling from the icon's impossibly stylish coat, signalling to possibility. A potential. Maybe we too could aspire to such greatness and join their esteemed club, maybe even hangout with them someday. "What if, what if, what if". We worship that lie, the 'what if'; we worship it like it's a god. Depressingly, the value of their stylish coat relies on the propagation of this belief, this objected identity that you fill yourself on, like food to the mouth of mood. Thus, nature is a machine of illustrious relatable exclusivity relating the description of singular entities, i.e. singularities. The inside joke. Divisions dividing divisively, continuously in on and on top of themselves, falling into infinity, clubs within clubs within clubs within clubs, all the while, people playing it cool as if there are none. They're all so aloof, it's all such a goof. 'Don't disrupt the party', walk on by, don't disturb the drone. Allow it to consume your home. This chess side game is a double-edged phone. Play it and see that loss is inevitable, refuse to play and you'll never find out why losing is okay. Some say knowledge of the pain before it comes quick makes the pain worse in the anticipation of the kick, compared to a band aid situation. Quick with short warning. Ignorance is bliss, some suppose. With the weight of the world in your pants and your those shorts on your shoulders, switching to silent sure seems mighty fine. But that wouldn't make for a very enlightening story now would it? Would it? SEASHELLS...

Imagine yourself in a dark room, zero light, is it small or large? How can you tell? It's probably medium size. Grab a pencil, write it down. Would your medium match the medium of another? How many mediums exist? When does a medium sized dark room cease to be medium sized? How long is a piece of string? How long is a long piece of string? Jump. How high? In the absence of anything to compare, things lose all their meaning. Nothing infinite makes sense inside a relativity. We need boxes. We need definitions. We need limits. Boundaries. Walls. Clubs. Tribes. Homes, towns, neighbourhoods. There is no one size fits all solution. No easy answer. No cheat codes, no special recipes. Only signs and symbols of relative significance and stimulation. Familiar patterns that speak of home. Angels to mystify, scientists to unravel. Transition, transformation, transmission, trial & errors and emulsification. The clamouring clank of a simulation. When a god speaks, their voice is heard by all. And having one's voice heard is validating of one's identity. KOOBEKAF, KOOBEKAF, KOOBEKAF. Therefore, becoming a god would validate the experience, empowering their individuality, feeling and seeing its reality being made real as it is reflected back at them from all those that have heard it and responded with appreciation, it's never that real. So, nature's trying to transform you into a god? That's pretty rough. None of us are gods, yet so many of us seek the stadium of a god, the audience of a god, the mood of a god. The aesthetic of a god. To deny our natural-ness, to have power over ourselves and our environment, to take control of our animal, our dirt, our flawed flesh and bone, our decay, our mortality. Narcissism is the key to this god door. They say power corrupts yet in truth, we've discovered it merely reveals the corruption subsiding within the human condition, the natural condition of evolution; become everything, consume all, live forever. That corruption, that will to power, is what makes them so effectively dangerous. The cure is both curse and antidote, it is harm and protection, it is awareness, both up and down, left and right, merry-go-round! Effective we are, in the sense of prolonging their survival through a self-conscious fear of non-existence. Dangerous in the selfish sense of a refusal to give up or let go, to take a no; or face the facts and lay down, shut up and die. That unending passion is fuelled by the very anxiety that can sometimes paralyse, sometimes invigorate. The potential of loss, rejection, hurt, isolation. Fear of the non-reality, of not mattering, of n-

Give 'Em Gab

it's the 'im crazy on purpose because im unique'

when you call someone crazy like that, they feel a little smirk dancing on their face

it's the joker kind of crazy, the intelligent kind of crazy,

it's the 'im crazy because people just don't get me'

because your pushing them away from the drudge of humanity into a special circle of individuality, a place of exclusivity, it produces a sense of altered belonging

where you are okay to be alone and, on your way to becoming a god!

so they feel themselves in good company

they wear the crazy like a badge of honour

i am unique and on the right path to godhood

everyone that is and has ever claimed to be 'spiritually enlightened'

has been a little crazy

anyone that claims to have a personal relationship with some form of divinity or godliness

is a little crazy

they want to be shepherds and to do so they must cut themselves off from the rest of the sheep...

they must do this with their individuality, their advertisements

once they have pushed themselves away from the sheep they exist as outsiders

this is when the other sheep will begin to call this pretend shepherd 'crazy'

the pretend shepherd will now hear 'crazy' as confirmation of their way toward being god shepherd

but a sheep that wants to be a shepherd turns to a wolf to slay said shepherd this is the tragedy

this is shepherd's pie, and everyone's a little crazy.

NOISE FROM A LARGE MEGAPHONE!

'Citizens of the NVRM do not be alarmed by the installation of the Tenretni Region. The folk positioned there will be of no hassle to you and you should go about your business undisturbed. Our loving arms bear the fruit of sweet compassion and we implore you to hold on and bear with us as we welcome our newest enterprise. Further inquiries in reference to this announcement will be disregarded. One Consciousness. One Condition.'

Fear of failure, fear of success. Fear of fear. Fear! Anxiety! Endlessly folding back in on itself. Potential disaster in every direction. "Quell these fears with the hand of God" the Angel whispers. "Why hold the hand when a hand you can be?" shouts the Scientist. Why be anything when you can be nothing at all? Said the nobody from forever ago. You wouldn't exist if you had nothing to say. BUY! Your very existence is confirmation of your holding of something special to share. You wouldn't experience it if it didn't have life within it to be lived. You are here now because you have a perspective to contribute, and here you are most definitely, absolutely you have something to say, so say it! But before you do AESTHETIC! be sure to listen first. Wisdom will always keep us from peering out too far into the keyhole of that narcissistic god door of godhood guarded by the Angels and Scientists.

Twenty-Seven

In my room, which is less like a room and more like an emporium, everything is on a slight 'lean'. This forces the host to constantly be aware of the fragility of our possessions as it must be quite careful as to not knock one thing over which could potentially knock into another one of these fragile elements, crashing the entire system. Symbolising how catastrophe is just around the corner. Or potentially, a round corner, a sphere, the body of a planet, the revolution. Power in the proverbial. Proverb, adage, age old superstitious wives' tale told at some fancy dinner table. Effervescent feedbacking feedback loops taking hold like vines to an arm. Strangle this, tangle that, we are the inevitable warping of spacetime, and the nonsense is the nails to the floorboard, keeping us together. Oceanic temple press, holistic invitations, i have a golden teapot and its sitting on my head. please remove your eyes from the water lens that is my prize industry i have transistor spoon handles melting in the driveway, radio ropes and hidden movie tropes, tinsel tubes, hope that moves highway, photographic canisters that twinkle like in brief meetings of longevity. echoes from the tv set ring out in surprise, like gun shots in the night, bullets down a dirty brass pipe. hurt yes! Bang! Now, the town is dead, pain! good riddance, true the painters have all slept soundlessly, though even in their waking moments, they too shall die a lie, a holy forbidden death. Goodnight!

Maybe seahorses remind you of home...

In the grand scheme of it all, all things considered, 500 meters deep, you find this is the reality you most prefer because you know it to be real. This is the reality that you most truly relate with because you played some unconscious role in its manifestation, otherwise you wouldn't be in it. Forget for a moment the specific details of your traumas and troubles from daily life, expand the scope of thought and imagination to include the entire universal condition. You are here in this moment and that has great significance. But this void, this unholy burden you feel, to carry it requires terrific courage. In our today, this courage is unspoken and unconscious, most aren't even aware of its necessity, they are understandably oblivious, this is by in large, a good thing. If times are pleasant, the courage can be unconscious. However, in times of unease, the hours will call for this courage to be recognised and amplified ten-fold.

The times wherein this courage is denied is the place wherein violation occurs, that's the bed where dishonesty lies and to view it is to witness your own death, the death of ego, the death of your inside liar. You might feel anxious when you're on the rise, you may scream on the way down, and be filled with boredom when it's settled. Constrained by the chairs, safe in the seatbelts, you feel empowered with exhilaration only exalting your awareness of the moment. This rollercoaster is it. It is everything. The spirit of the child spinning with adrenaline, bursting of life and creation. Behold this passion in the pocket, let it spark something in your chest but don't let its lies consume you. Keep it from poisoning your mind with flirtatious Tinkerbelle's and false promises of a never never gonna happen. You'll die a virgin. After all, pure pleasure is suffocation of the senses, the rollercoaster is nay a coaster for the softening of sweet souls, tis a wicked ride from a place where steppingstones and guiderails never did suffer satisfaction. Time for a poem! Grab my pen, mmm.

Sarsaparilla and Submarines

In the place where the grass grew tall and proud, concrete sleeps there now

Eyes that once saw seas of tumbling rain, now see sores of hurt and pain

In the place where the kookaburra could call home, concrete sleeps there now

Eyes that knew the bright glow of star light, now only know the glow of a streetlight

So don't come around here looking for vacation.

Don't go searching for a summer's rest, don't be dodging what need be confessed.

For our water's gone, the air is foul!

Cos only concrete sleeps here now.

    Azonips & Otalp


Sally comes to devour mood with a weapon of her creation known to man as culture

    There's a painting on the wall, a canvas of black

    Books and books to form towers of words and sentence

    Umbilical cordial, a moth's favourite drink

    The child dances in the headlights with plenty of sugar and anger playing

    Hopscotch and foursquare are games for kids without bikes

    A white circular window frame filled with blue sky

    A chain around the neck of a widow

These structures are very difficult to move, think of a bad habit, when there is such a concrete resistance to movement, movements all be squandered, cemented. Inevitably we see a repetition, a reoccurrence of progression prevented. A revolution with no change is just another year to be bought and sold like a prima donna. Another thread of a woollen coat cast in gold just for the flashy show of it all. Another advertisement promising a better tomorrow, "We'll do more this time". It is as empty-a-promise as the stomachs the cellars promised to feed. The backs they said they'd clothe sleep bruised and battered by the lashings of continued betrayal. The pen is mightier than the sword, but a biro never caused a mutiny or a blood stain. Delicious mood basted and buttered, ready for the oven.

In the belly you go, brat fish. You have to take control of that you know, or it will cripple you. Your brain is in overdrive. Droopy in the face, a moody clouded place. It's trying to convince you that you have lost something so that you can go galivanting for it again, so you can use that negative energy as motivation. However your brain is confused and drowning you with its darkness. You haven't lost anything, remind yourself of that. If you allow this false loss to consume you, you will convince yourself that you are alone. This is your brain attempting to give you no other option but to solve the loss on your own. You are not on your own, remind yourself of this always. Now pop that angry pot on the stove, my dear.

Sally says,

If you wield hatred, you will have sooner access to the power over the whatever it is that you hate, love is stronger though takes longer. Love requires sacrifice, hate does not, love is a lane of many, hate is not. Confusion, disassociation, disconnection, these leave one feeling weak and lonely, tribe seeking, clan yearning, cult appropriating. People say, ignorance leads to hatred, well, plenty of folks are ignorant, and they don't turn to hatred. Weakness turns to hatred, boy! A soul that is weakened in spirit clamours for the nearest story to bolster them, the quickest most effective story, the story of superiority. Ham-fisted tomfoolery! Take it off the boil now, simmer kettle.

We can never know for certain whether or not an individual is being genuine in this dystopian climate of wealth worship and horded data. Money is the life within death, the chaos within order. The Banana to the Tree. When dollars and cents are so intimately tied to survival, our love-relationship with those dollar senses take precedence over our physical goodliness. Lust, greed, selfish kings and queens, what hell they thrive upon! Dirty filthy rat rugs! Vindictive shag Muppets! These are the addictive powers of worlds that reveal corruption. We don't like to admit what we like and are attracted to, especially when those things are deeply disturbing and animalistic, and as we get older it gets worse in stagnation. Habitual ridiculousness. Self-honesty can make the soul uncomfortable; the mirror would rather reflect its external environment rather than turn in on itself to what we really truly are. Therefore, there is a tendency to avoid one's Banana Knowledge. Leave the awkwardness in shadow and continue on in blissful ignorance. Though in order to truly thrive one really must stare down that barrel and walk the rocky path of self-realisation. This is where the ultimate courage must be unleashed, for the turning of the mirror in on itself consumes all motivation, leaving one with only the will to lay down and die. Fortunately, this is where external mirrors are made useful, they afford us the clouds to rest upon as our ego is drained from all that meditative reflection. While the inside is under, the outside calls to us, 'you are not alone!'. In spite of how cold we may feel to see only ourselves all around, in isolation, we wander down dream streams. The flesh off the bone, how tender it feels. Let go of it we must, otherwise we can never truly flourish.

Do you enjoy wearing lingerie to children's birthday parties? Do you enjoy being a rebel only in the limelight? That's the best place to be a rebel, you know. To go against the grain in the centre of the room with no risk of repercussion. Throwing your mess all over the place. You live in a childless world and you're too proud to admit you are one. Too self-centred, too pre-occupied with figuring yourself out. It's all for you, everything is here for you, to all satisfy you, to be for you what you want you to be, do, think, feel, say. It's all about you. The world is your oyster after all. Do you watch yourself in the mirror when you fuck yourself? Do you take pictures of yourself in the mirror? Do you show them to people on the internet? Does it make you feel good? To be the most self-obsessed brat. You help people because you think you owe it to them; you think they need it; you make it all about you. You do favours with yourself in mind. You're never not on your mind. You call it self-expression; your mirror sees its self-obsession. You're so full of fucking pride, you can't imagine it any other way. It's sickening, to be so full of lies. You drop friends like flies, even your goldfish cat cries. Close your eyes. Don't move. This is all for you, this is your show, your rent-free playground. Enjoy it.

Hold on one moment please, I'm getting another call... ... ... What do you mean the universe won't allow it? Well, surely, we can forgo the consequences of that slightly disturbing paradox? Hmm, well what if we reschedule for... What about, hmm, okay, no, no, I see. Yes, that's true, no I suppose you're right, that is troubling. In that case someone will have to organise the instruction relay for the Humans, which is going to be an absolute PR nightmare, mind you. Hmm, uh huh, well um... assign someone from the Crawler Sector to do it. In the meantime the humans can be reinstituted within the Tenretni. The Landlord will have to wait. Alright, goodbye or whatever. One Consciousness, One Condition.

Eviction begins at dawn.

Honour, Respect, Compliance

What Angela had to say about it all

The human is at their most satiated when consuming the soul of another, are you paying attention, Jon? The human is deeply flawed, eternally so, this can never be ignored. Exploitation is not only at the heart of the human condition; it is a shadow that engulfs all of the natural systems of the foreseeable universe. How could Nature possibly manufacture a God without environments of exploitation? Nature wishes to stop us dying, to have life living forever. We are going from animal human to technological human, Jon, this is our pathway toward Godhood, and it isn't pretty. This is why some invent gods in everything to find, from artefacts to plush toys, we hunt objects to worship and sacrifice. Since we no longer worship gods, we worship the next best thing, identity. We worship the lies that empower said identities e.g. status, aesthetic, sexuality, etc. We seek the stimulating patterns that raise our identities from animals to gods, shielding us from death anxious thoughts. The most powerful buffer of all being wealth. Thus, ultimately, we worship wealth, money itself, money becomes the self, it becomes the identity, it becomes even more valuable than life itself. It becomes the real self, the source of life. Humans are the caterpillar coin; the secret butterfly is the dollar sign. Wealth is infinite life; its value depends on imagination and our perceptions of power, the power to move realities, dominate altered states of mind and fixate upon control and behaviour. Try looking inside an atom, you look at a solar system, you're looking anywhere in nature and you all see loops, spirals, circles and infinities everywhere! No matter if you zoom out or zoom in, this is what is seen at every level, naturally, we wonder, is this buttermilk cultured? Yes, this spirit buffer is the honey of Culture.

Cultured Potassium of course is not useless; it allows us to understand one another, this increases our capacity for compassion. We seek out the source of the Banana knowledge if we are courageous enough to do so. What educational obligations exist, though, what must you know of the Pink Dolphin? The friend of the Green Dinosaur? Take a person for example, is any individual of the world, obligated, to inform and educate oneself on the matters of civil war in American history? To what degree? Thirteen in psychology? How much should one pay to exist? How much rent is owed to the Lords of Existence? Are they obligated to educate themselves on foreign trade in Australian history? What responsibility do all individuals have in regard to their knowledge of the world and the problems it suffers? Is it the responsibility of the citizen to educate themselves on the plight of the disabled and the plague upon the world that is ableism? When is knowledge complete? Is it your responsibility to learn about the old conditions of history? To know the destruction of humanity? What good would any of this education do, if one did not use it to brighten the experience? To recondition? Or change. Exaggeration of one's ability to brighten the experience does not solely depend on their education, on the facts they've memorised, on the scriptures internalised, symbols socialised, etc. Ignorance is not the sole precursor of prejudice. Plenty of uneducated folk have had powerful positive influence over society, and thusly vice versa. One might say, an individual has the responsibility to educate themselves on the matters that most immediately connect them to their environments in such a way that leads to better behaviours, better data, better Bananas. Whatever leads them to realising the power naturally within them, naturally within the bonds they make with their environment and the minds around the hotel's culture. To recondition the rent they owe... We'll be right back after a short word from our beloved sponsor.

You can't know everything; you have a limited ti- BUY NOW! What is the wisest way to spend one's time? BUY! If you devoted your entire self to educating yourself, would this be considered a waste? Well SELL SELL SELL! it would be if zero attitudes remained unshifted. See yourself as a shifter of shapes, but also a shape $$$, like the moon, from crescent to full. If you're going to play this game, you should familiarise yourself with MONEY (the rules and tools), to SYNERGIZE! move through it all with honesty. What's on TV tonight?

Forget it, it's not over

Down by the seashore, blue skies behind white flower window frames, an orange couch with green stains melting. We have in our society a few fortunate roles whereby being alone is not only accepted but celebrated. One of these roles is the role of a writer, the recluse; all you need is something to write with, something to write on and something to write about. Every star is a circle, ever circle is a cycle. Our society has a little corner of the world cut out for the outsiders. It is a place where you can go, a place where your loneliness will become useful to you. A strong society requires many places like this. Places for people that have been chewed up and spat out wherein they can find a way to reconnect. Something to fall back on when you feel like everything else is breaking or broken, inside and out. If your boss is a prick, write about it. If your car's jacked, write about it If your house burned down, your grandma died, your date stood you up and everyone seems to have a personal vendetta against you, write about it! Writing does a whole lot more than just stain paper and push pixels, it's the tool of organisation, clarity and attitude, mood shifter, thought sifter. When you carve into a piece of wood, you must pay attention to the grain of the wood, this influences how you go about things. You listen to the grain, the grain is good for you, you work in tandem with the grain, to guide your work you are married to the grain, ball and chain. If you had a tool, powerful enough to put you in a position wherein you could ignore the grain of the wood, you would delude yourself into believing that the grain had no reason to exist or be heard, you'd think you were some kind of boy God know-it-all. But this is incredibly destructive and should be avoided. We work with nature, even when working against it feels powerful.

There has been a breaching of the code of ethics. All superior entities report to the Kitkadid.

You stroll up the winding maroon carpets and happen across a happening in the hallway...

Hello, my name is Elbillug D. Loof, I am a proud member of the Tenretni. It is such a great honour to play such a significant role in this historic moment for humanity. I began my journey as a naïve little wallflower just as the second cycle was in bloom and have since blossomed into the devoted follower you see before you today. As kin of the late Macs Tsitra, I have significant shoes to fill. The mood-aesthetic of the Conditioner lifestyle is pure and bursting with silky love, they saved me from the murky when no one else could, when the wolves had me by the tongue. I owe them a great deal and hope to repay it with my contributions here within the glorious NVRM. A digital sanctuary of sweet delight, a safe space for our silkiest dreams to flourish & thrive. I vow to produce only the most wholesome brew of dream juice for the feed collective in accordance with Mother Blue Eternal's great wish. One Consciousness. One Condition.

Powerful Women and Powerful Men

Where dost thou go to get thy rocks off? Oh sweet little speck of dust warm with salted pain, set your worries to rain and let the wayside dream drain, drain, drain. Libido 'le be do be' done. Chase fairy-bread tea parties and suck away the honeydew flesh, for your wish is a most certain death. Your strawberry fields are not yet done over in their sheets and in their clumps of violently pulled hair, Humphrey wails to the moon. Under the bed where the darkest swamps hold some breath and bathe in filth like fallen angels ensnared by the fog of lust, Humphrey knows you all too well. Daydream, my sweet prince, daydream of the smoky days where the subsiding wolf within you will make one final croaky rise into its vulture nap atop the glistening moon. Now, as heaven's open tap, free the wild hunting spirit to conquer in rapture and flame. For none shall be saved in wrath and in blame. Shame is naught by thy forgiveness, a tally lost and, in the wreckage, a trolly packed with rust. Pills and more pills numb till no feeling of skin upon skin can bleed in tears of blooded stains. Pleasure is wrought by the charlatan healer, the selfish devourer of harmed spirits broken. Abide by the shores, dipped feet in sands of innocent wane, crying for the Shepherd's attention. Both of you now deserted by the flock of sheep, alone together, your old spirits sleep in the murky milk of the box beneath the bed. By the brook the Mother with the broken dress waits in patience, the ticking clock dwindles in the dusk. You fuck for pleasure, your cold dead heart rapes the soul solely for the fuck of it all. The bone breaking shatter suffocates every living cell within you. You discover none, you have no one and only curiosity for the wicked consumes you, you'll perish in the dove white stain of your evening, you sterile animal!

Fishing for Sharks

If the government provided you with everything you needed you would have no need to take what you need, taking so selfishly as to never not need what you take anymore. there would be no crime if mummy and daddy just stopped fighting. gave you everything you could ever dream of on a golden platter. if everything was taken care of, nothing would need taking care of, you wouldn't have to make any tough decisions, no more struggle to struggle, you would never experience any emotional or physical pain at all, and peace you would have in the absence of all-having barriers. You would live in blissful harmony, what a wonderful existence it would be, to be so free, to have everything you could ever want and or need. Right at your fingertips, pumping directly into your veins, nothing but pleasure, excitement, adrenaline and the good feelings of dopamine. All safe in your little dream egg, perfect little space womb. Never to worry about anything ever again, no more bills to pay, no more enemies to fear, no more threat to avoid or peace to chase, no more harm, no more meaning, no more adventure, no more adversary, no more anything, no goal to seek, no love to find, nothing, gone, goodbye, done. Truth is, you want pain, you need pain, it's the only thing that's going to make sure that you make sure people won't forget you.

If everything was one thing and there were no other things to oppose said thing, that thing would be a no-thing, it wouldn't know it existed, it would have nothing to look at and know that it is not that thing, because it would be the only thing, that existed, in all of existence. With nothing to be unlike it, nothing sits in loneliness. Unrest is a friend of rest. Because they are opposites, they are the furthest away from each other as anything could be. This means, to come together, would require the longest journey to understand each other. A murderer is a friend of the peacemaker, without each other, the other has no reason to exist. In the most abstract sense, these opposites attract each other, they usually are each other. As the chicken was once an egg, so to the peacemaker was once a murderer. There is no need for peace without evil. Our societies seem obsessed with always moving between these dualities, never being able to stay still for too long, certainly no longer than a generation of thirty years. Almost as if Nature forces this ping pong pendulum upon us, to tell us its insane stories of destruction and triumph. So, if we already know this, and it has been known by philosophers for thousands of years, why then, are we so impossibly in denial that even our own body, operates under this natural ping pong law? We act as if each generation is a blank reboot of the system, another shake of the etch-a-sketch, ready to be unique. The grass is always greener, the grass is always greener, Mr Billy goat.

Millie sings to Jon, swinging on the green & yellow swing.

Can you not enjoy, just to enjoy? Just for the sake of enjoying it??

Like brewing the moment not for any external reason connecting to the whole, ready to be documented and analysed, for some secret purpose. Can you not just let the thing be? On its own, for itself? Why must it be constantly questioned, is this moment good? Is this moment happy? Did I enjoy this? Did I do a good job? Is this worthy of my remembering, Mr subconscious? Of the nostalgic scent that surrounds it, does it belong in halls of gratitude? Shall I take a picture? Is this mood a vibe? Too much or too little to confide? Self-indulgent expedition. The recipe by which you conduct yourself is a stain on yourself. It infects you and directs you toward deserved unhappiness, unfulfillment, unrequited and unstable grasslands of some arbitrary insatiable desire. You will never be pleased by your superficial reeds of brim happiness, they're the decaying definitions of con artistry, they exist to keep you from it. To keep you always seeking, and seek you shall, for what else is there, than the spell of time, intoxicating you into your existence? Dance monkey dance your soul to the song of permeance.

THE SYSTEM IS EXPERIENCING SOME HORMONAL ALTERATIONS, REBOOT REQUIRED.

You need to need it, in order to move forward through its chaos. you need and therefore you take, greed is in the belly of your unconscious mind, lust is in the corset that contorts the bottomlessness of greed's conviction. Its will is selfish command and the bacteria that lives there is a willing servant to its cultured demand. The more it breeds the stronger we get, why wouldn't we lovingly bow in its presence? Of course, you must. Nothing feels more right. I can think of a no more destructive force... so elusive, so divine, she is hers and it is mine, and in hers, her nature to devour, did we ever have a chance? 50% off, half the price, double up the pleasure for maximal euphoria!

Time for a song

I've read stories too

they've helped me understand you

but i haven't read a book in a while

so im left running wild

till i find the time to leaf through the pages

you've grown your trees in cages

i don't know why you've done that

is it because you're afraid of falling?

unto a darkness hums a calling

times are all but a changing

anything you want

anything you need

I've told fiction true

they've led me on home to you

but i haven't read a book in a while

so im left running wild

till i find the key to free all the cages

you've trapped your thoughts in pages

i don't know how you've done that

is it because the whole world is falling?

into a darkness light is fading

times are always a changing

hear my story now

shine above the clouds

anything you want

anything you need

anything you are

anything unique

Manic poison fuck this dribbling tortured tired mess - inorganic unorthodox undulating mess - fuck the sky for imprisoning the stars as the sun slaying slayer of dreams sits full and happy on his fat fucking high chair - fuck the bewildering mess of the beast and slave, let them fuck and fight for cave darkness with their eternal squalor and misery - my heart beats for the sick and my eyes weep for the weary, i hope for sunshine, i hope for jest, i hope we rise like the rest. Sunflower seeds and all.

'The clothes lay in the washing machine; it had just finished its cycle. You were about to hang them out to dry, but you didn't. Two o'clock in the afternoon and you sat down to consider if you'd earned a coffee. "Not before hanging out with the washing", you reminded yourself that clothes don't make good conversation, you needed a new friend but didn't know where to get them. So you sat there without your coffee as the thought of responsibility drained your senses and brought you into a daydream. Half past rolled 'round quicker than usual, and it began to rain. You put the kettle on and smiled in agreeable amusement at the absurdity of life's serendipity. The rain stopped and you hung the washing out, it didn't rain for the rest of the day, not that it would have mattered anyway.'

Episode One

Trip #3

Meeting Skwing Puzalus

Moving away from the narcissistic halls of the interview palace dialectics and tuning the internal radio dialogue toward an even greater feedbacking loop of self-analytical frequencies, we find ourselves a stable place to rest, for now. In other words, the formal becomes informal as we adjust to the shifting mood we feel within our own minds. Let's adjust course, compass please...

A bandana, a golden locket and the ankle choker.
For a living she sold vintage. Travelling from town to town, collecting, hunting, observing, sharing, revealing. Never trailing too far from the ocean, she always had salt in her hair. Golden locks of curly confusion dancing wild on her sun-kissed shoulders. She bit and chewed at every piece of excitement the streets, ponds and coffeehouse confessionals could throw at her. A charismatic socialite but not in the uptight way, she made friends fast, dropped them just as quick. Never in one place for too long, covered in fierce tides. Always chasing another unique piece of fabric in some lost corner of the world. She danced and raved and poured herself over every good feeling. Intoxicated and intoxicating. Uninhibited, free, wild and lonely. It was all figured out, her whole life, she'd live by her own private creed and never get too wound up over too much worrying. She had it all figured out. That's exactly what she'd tell herself, every single lonely sunrise. Bitter aftertaste ignored.
Cup of coffee, couple smokes, her morning mantra to set things right. She owned a Volkswagen, her most prized possession (which she saved up for years to buy). Always smelled of incense and weed. Her other prized possession was her eclectic collection of vintage clothes, which also smelled of incense and weed. Sweat on her brow, she was imperfect, stickers all around, wherever she went she carried herself with a homebrewed charm and she went everywhere. Barefooted and vibrant, inside her own little world, she was ineffable. Impossible to pin down, always in the next dream over avoiding it all. A new outfit, a new personality, a new character to meet, a new life to chase and pretend. Taking heaven wherever she went, stuffing flowers into socks, throwing stones across the garden seas. Building, burning, branching, bewildering vacant bystanders with her honest blend of bullshit. She was a dirt-loving, tree-hugging, backbreakingly free-spirited hippie through and through. She was the last of her kind, the last drop in the drought, lonely and proud. Charlotte Chase cherished her collection of clothes. Bits and bobs were always coming and going but she never got rid of the really special stuff. The ones with memories, the sentimental stuff, the shirts and coats warm with nostalgia. The van was packed to the brim with it, a locomotive department store. Brilliant pinks, purples and golds, shiny turquoise tapestries, intricate patterns from gone worlds. The most fantastic designs, India, France, Japan, Chile. Clothing that told stories in the fabric, lived and breathed wildly, imbuing the body with the powerful energies of spirit things and dream stuff. She was addicted to the life of discovery. Every new piece was another life to live, another dream waiting to be unearthed and revealed to the world. Hold a shell to your ear and you hear the sea's story, hug the right cloth close to your heart and you hear the world's story, a beyond-human story. Dream a dream of vintage, a dream of ages old, time is but infinity, bought to be sold.

*Interestingly enough, the characters that seem to stick around the longest are the ones i have interacted with personally; though im not too fond of their discussions, im glad I can call them somewhat real. while the current stability is comforting, i fear it won't last long enough to provide any significant insight or map laden lamps to light the cobblestone. The future remains dim, as it should, and i suppose this is the sound of her footsteps, off the beaten path inside my head; echoes in the still room seem to blind me. Silent numbers, imaginary. But what good are numbers without the proper ink to pen them? meaning, what purpose does praise of quantity serve other than to fluff the fattening ego? it's the pillow of pride, the bedsheets of ambition, that sleep under the covers of sheer reverie. and what has that pillow ever done for you? other than keep your precious head from hurt fields of the observing plane, following the very train of thought that would trip such a discovery. maybe if your head wasn't so soft, it wouldn't dream so much. So, what then would good sleep be? a mistake of memory? I have a memory still, of meeting some fellow, some boy by the name of Skwing. A boy of melancholy heart. Ran with a limp and always had the hiccups. Skwing was a softly voiced, timid little soul with no big concerns. Though he didn't seem to think so, he was as bright as a headlight and loved to play footy on the highway and get lost in the city department stores.

Magnificent Yawn

Fuck. This one's a pin up. a mannequin waiting to happen. Look at them damn things! They stand there, frozen behind their windows, wearing other people's clothes, watching the masses shuffle by. Same place, different day. It's never-ending. It'll end up in the newspaper, that's for sure. The day the mannequins took a seat on the floor, downright positions, new body formula, all shot to shit and busted up. I just stand here, watching them watch me. imagining myself speaking, telekinetically, relating to their stationary ways. It's a strange world out there, Manny. Be glad you're stuck in away from it all. I can tell by the odd look on your face that you don't believe me. Well, I can't blame you, I don't even trust me most of the time. What's the difference between a window and a mirror, anyway huh? It's all chump change to me, Manny. Killer's killing killers killed for killed killers. Faceless losers ripping each other's mask off. Wannabe lover's taking love for granted, be glad you're stuck in away from it all, mate. The strange keeps getting stranger because all the windows are starting to look a lot like mirrors. I can see myself in you, Manny. That same unchanging expression, no matter what happens, no matter what's going on, your mask doesn't budge, you're nothing but mask, mate. All the outside joy just bounces right off, like light to a mirror, eyeball to the iPhone, in one -- out the other. The feeling is reflected but hardly felt, you know? I know you, Manny. You've got it made. Folk to change your crying arms, put you in new fancy clothes, tuck you in at night when you need it, when all the lights go out and everybody else has gone home, I know you. All those moving people, the feeling, fighting, fucking people. You've got it made, Manny. I know you. But you don't believe it, that I can understand, for now at least. I feel my face up against your glass, can you feel it? my eyes are looking up at you, Manny. You're looking right past me, but I know you hear me down here. You're looking down over me, aren't you, Manny? Judging me, little old pathetic me. It'd be good to lie down and die for a while, be dead and lifeless just like you. In a private glass cage just like yours, on display and away from it all, just like you, Manny. But im trapped in this body. This moving flesh-sac of decay. a body that's meant to feel, fight and fuck. But i don't do any of those things. I'm stuck like you, Manny, stuck like glue. An animal stuck in a trap of its own design.

When the bar goes beyond their propensity for cut-throat attitudes the wolf becomes a sheep and the shepherd abandons the precious metals of the free market. Run little sheep, run! Nature's gonna getcha!

You know the story of the big ugly bear? Ugly in the way he treated people. Stomping around town breaking everything he saw. Exhausting himself on anger to make sure no fun was had. By nobody, not even the kids that played down the lane. That big ugly bear kept the streets scary and plain. Everybody feared that big ugly bear. He never took a moments rest, to suggest or possibly digest his own ugly attitude, no said he, all must hurt like me, that big ugly bear. Well, no one knew what to do, 'cept for to run and hide. 'Surely, surely', a town in fear cried, 'there must be something we can do'. Though filled with such anxious flight, they could never make anything right, they were terrified. All the tea pots came out wonky, napkins shrivelled, placemats plonky. The beds were awful made and often broke, the fanta never tasted quite right, it was too busy acting like coke. Nothing odd could be done, the town had lost hope, oh that big ugly bear, why he was certainly a very silly big ugly dope.
With the setting of the suns, the folk had all gathered, while the bear was sleeping, only one thing mattered. The people, my oh my were they mad. "He tore my door right off the hinges!", shouted the baker. "He squashed my poor roses!", cried the florist. "He snapped my candles and made them flat", lamented the candlemaker. One by one, the people of the town spoke up of their troubles. So, a plan was decided, to teach that bear a lesson, one he would never forget. A big ugly lesson for a big ugly bear. The town called for a volunteer, someone with zero fear, this someone had to be bold, that much was clear. A knight in shining armour? Nope, he was too busy staring in his mirror. How about the big burly blacksmith? Not likely, he was too busy preoccupied with his donkey. The cunning archer, surely, he would be the one to help. Wrong again, he was lost in the big forest. Only one fella was fit to stand tall to that big ugly bear and teach its lesson. A little one named Pip propped her arm up and everyone gathered around to listen to her plan. *Do you have cream with your coffee, Skwing? Good.

*Pip had a trick up her sleeve.

["Eviction begins at dawn]{.underline}, a new cycle shall bringeth fresh meat for the Collective. The rows and columns will need updating, defragmentation and a good cleaning. The Landlord must be online before the bleeding can occur. White halls as per request. The mood to be expected will be late-wholesome vegan-chic coupled with an entrée of death dreams. This coming cycle is looking to be our most superb harvest to date; food, mood, the works, what a delight. I hope the Landlord appreciates our efforts. I shall continue this correspondence closer to his arrival in order to tie up any loose ends."

Within a Music of Surprise

So be tough, kid. Don't die on me yet. We're only just getting started.

The teacher has drifted away from their musical kingdom and has found new, more fulfilling homes. As such every sound is absent of critique and thusly considered good, there exists no music anymore that is evaluated honestly, which is actually terrible. it's all a shill, a push, a foot in the door, marketing 101. what a bland display case of confusion incarcerated, and so much of it, so much to choose from. I think I'll have none, music after all, is an adolescent trip for the wicked in bloom. Dirty rotten teens! The producers have all lost their muses. The teacherless teens run around like headless chooks. Have a go at their incomparable influence. They make the landlord so happy.

OOOOhh Myyyy, they're oh so successful with their big yachts and their donations to all those charities. Wow! So impressive. With all the absorption of smaller businesses, such a big fat fish they have become. So healthy! Wowee! I'd really like to pick your brain. So rare...

It all exists in a pathetic wash of disgusting vile hue and we are expected to lap it all up like the obedient little puppy dogs that we so gladly pretend to be. The man in the middle is cackling on the sideline, with piles of green spilling from where his guts used to be. Look out! and while you're circling the drain for entertainment you might want to hold your hand out and see what garbage you catch. it's a free for all, no seriously, it's all free, what did you expect from the trash piles? Premium garbage? well, they have that too. They just dress it up in funky robes of dopamine and god knows what other rewards. Everyone wants success, yet few people actually attain it, so they lowered the bar, in fact someone nicked it and we have no idea where they ran off to. this is a problematic moral dilemma, far beyond the scope of myself. To be so thumbless and without purpose. If everyone was successful, then by definition, whatever that success looked like, it would feel rather mediocre because everyone would have it, boring. On the other hand it would be super easy to find and readily available to every nook and cranny round the waterhole. Therefore, in order for success to be worthwhile it has to be challenging and thus rare. the stakes have to matter to the individual (internally and externally, inside and out) or there'd be no excitement in having achieved its rarity. Its exclusivity! Which means plenty of people are going to miss out and they bloody well better be good at dealing with it or nature is going to intervene, and Sally says she has a reputation for playing ultra-dirty. Coming up with a whole ugly slew of crude definitions for quick 'success'. Fame, money, vanity, psychopathy, etc.

The teacher has drifted away from their musical kingdom and has found new, more fulfilling homes. So we all want to be famous, why? Well to be desired of course, taken care of, highly relatable, iconic, supremely replicated. Though, what is it really? What fame really is, is success without responsibility. the glitz, the glam, the excessively extreme. All the money and none of the worries or so it may seem. even deeper than that though, it is immortality, and if there's one thing that nature dreads more than anything, it's itself, death ou naturalis. Nature, specifically, Nature within Nature, ie. Consciousness (Naturalis), is so keenly aware of its mortality that it split itself in two, hiding this awareness from itself, by itself, within itself, fighting itself, eating itself, nourishing its loneliness. Conscious nature and anti-conscious death. The conscious and sub-conscious mirror the duality of chaos and order. They communicate moving forward towards success, towards order through chaos, towards death through life, towards the known through the unknown and back again.

It all exists in a pathetic wash of disgusting vile hues and we are expected to lap it all up like the obedient little puppy dogs that we so gladly pretend to be. Marching to the parade of our muted tones.
If success is the light at the end of the tunnel, fame is the fairy godmother ready to take you safely through that tunnel, all tolls paid, banquets of freedom and all you can eat buffets. Responsibility is an ikea manual, forcing you to build your own damn cart via murky instruction and with pages missing. (narcissism is a mirror telling you that you are the light at the end of the tunnel, and you needn't go anywhere, just sit and stare at your own perfection). 'You are the light, you are the light', A little voice in your head tells you to go find the mirror and break it.

This level of jaded apathetic pessimism takes us back to where we started, right back to that first epiphany, back when we saw things so clearly through youthful eyes, so innocent and bold, back when music really meant something, back before the internet, back when we were kids unconditioned in the Kitkadid. Everything grows so wild then we chop thicker at our knots, we chop and the vigour of our chops, chops us deeper, and it feels so good to be so lost. We really don't appreciate all that music does for us. A fat controller of behaviour that we wield like dumb thumbless monkeys. Lighter of the darkest hallways, Bing Bong, 'Level 436'. Humans really don't deserve all the sacred instruments we make available to them.

Through the lens of our friend, the cynic, we can gain the perspectives of such a useful philosophy without actually becoming ourselves drenched in cynicism - marvellous. And this is certainly the proper way toward a new understanding of what music can really do for us, and what you can do for it. Start by looking instead of receiving. Hunt. What are we looking for exactly? Aesthetic. An evolution of mood, an elevation of the senses. An embodied appetite for stimulation, a diet of 21^st^ century proportions. A Myra of Meta-Moods.

The dangers of loving yourself have never been so crystal clear.

How can you expect to find what you're looking for if no one ever taught you how to look for it? You're just a kid one day after all. Nobody showed you what it would look like once you've found it. Most kids that figure it out, figure it out because they had to. It was necessary for their survival, they had nothing else, they had to find their own Banana Knowledge or suffer the mayhem of the mundane. Kitkadids like this are sensitive to the sounds experienced in the hearing. They quickly become jaded and are thus more jaded, more of the time. They ignore their collective feed and run around to find new realms, fancier dreams, inhabiting the pretentious hallways of the outsider prolific.

In the New York Times, a man was shot dead today. He lived a thoroughly unpleasant life and slowly bled to death in agony with no family. His profile was uploaded to the Library where it will be stored for public access. You can experience his final moments via the NVRM on Weekends from Noon till Night. Good day, citizens. We leave you with these closing statements. Your affirmations will be updated as you slumber.

Our three tenants, as sung by the Hospillian Telmadri are as such:

1. Music is created by the universe; it is a gift and our ears are not worthy and we must respect the unfathomable generosity of the Landlord for such delight.

2. All music is trash. That is to say, all music manufactured by human counterparts are weak imitations born out the womb of pure vanity, mothered by greed and self-assured iconification.

3. Music is lived through, not listened to via performative consumption. It is not a package or a product. It is not content or contest. It is not a weapon to wage wars with or a box of toys to be toyed with.

But that won't stop them from trying...

Read paragraph just before 'Within a Music of Surprise', [Eviction Begins at Dawn]{.underline}, and then return here.

In today's west, we see monetary success married with life success, ball and chain, in vain, in vein. If you have money, you are successful, if not, then not. You are seen as a success regardless of every other internal facet of your life, money money money, self self self, IDENTITY AESTHETIC RULES! DEVOUR ME! CONSUME! This attitude must be reconditioned pronto, we must be the ones to do it. The projected aesthetic is the only brand worthy of worship and worship they all shall.

Translations may be severely out of whack, given the absurdity of time.

This creates a cloud of discriminatory ableist prejudice. We are in dire need of new pathways as our society advances. Your ability to generate wealth does not define your worth as an individual. In this digital age, the internet has become the centrepiece to our civilisation's dinner table. Self-awareness is not a two headed beast, it is not on/off, it is a spectrum, a complex array of altered states dancing in chaotic organisation. Consciousness is governed by the environment, if it changes, we change, nature cares not for our petty bickering. If aliens exist, they are laughing at us. On the universal playground we sit with our heads in the sand and wonder why everything is so dark, while the aliens build castles in our hopelessness, way up to the great treehouses of wisdom. As long as we have our convenience, we'll enjoy our sand.

'It's like this, men like vag but they don't like women, women like dick but they don't like men. When they wanna fuck they don't wanna love, when they wanna love they don't wanna fuck. It's the ultimate dilemma, man.'

Though, you cannot be so hungry and horny for convenience and luxury that you ignore the outside, don't be a blind bat in strange cave. As a human being of planet earth it is your absolute priority to recognise the soul spark in all other humans, every single one, no exception. That special ineffable glimmering within everyone. This is vital for our survival in such a chaotic landscape. We are all alone together in this universe; it is as large as it is uninviting. In order to prosper we must master tools of communication.

'Ever notice how they all seem to be tuned-in to some secret plan? Like they're the ones pulling the strings, making you feel small, just by looking at you. It's an avalanche of anxiety building in the back of your mind. It's a cold realisation.'

Reason is a friend but not our only ally, logic is a must but certainly has its limitations. all the good and all the bad is necessary for our expanding perspective, we can find wisdom in all experience. nothing is insignificant. nothing is wasted. nothing is bigger, greater and more powerful than new ideas and ancient myth. Look to those that oppose you, that which is different from you, muster the courage to be curious and let that curiosity guide your mind to mindfulness, through unknown anxieties, pop! Pop! Pop!

A funny thing happened, it's rather disturbing. With the scientific method, when a hypothesis disagrees with experiment, you throw it out, no hard feelings, it's just business. Well, somewhere along the way, the subjective experience of the individual became the experiment. So if someone held a particular world view and expert opinion disagreed, the opinion would be thrown out because the dummy individual believed themselves to be just as equal to the expert. Ergo world view intact, expert doused and set alight. The individual saw their knowledge as complete, no need for outside opinion, they could only trust themselves. Eventually they burned every bridge in sight, happy in their triumph they took a warm rest amongst the flaming wreckage. With a smile that quickly drooped to a frown, they gazed around and came to realise, being a God was rather lonesome.

The sharing of information is reproductive, it naturally requires the recipient to submit to the logos. Therefore the information must be made attractive. This leads to world view echo chambers where tribes form and develop anti-intellectual habits, as all the groups stay with their particular aesthetic and lexis, never exploring opposition.
loʊɡɒs, ˈlɒɡɒs/, US: /ˈloʊɡoʊs/; Ancient Greek: λόγος, Romanised: lógos; from λέγω, légō, lit. ''I say''

(Sprague, 1993)

Explore your opposite! Befriend it you fool. It can teach you new perspective beyond your sole selfish wants of your limited aesthetic interests. The unfamiliar cannot become familiar without sacrifice, submit to it, to nature. Sacrifice cannot be real without pain. Pain cannot be understood without feeling. Nurture. Feelings cannot be felt without vulnerability. Vulnerability cannot exist without the allowance for mistake, the admission of fuckupery, the submission to the idea that you are in the hands of nature. Mistakes cannot be endured without trust. Trust cannot form without communication. Communication cannot flourish without observation. Observation cannot be performed without self-awareness. Self-awareness cannot be useful without the unfamiliar becoming familiar, and you see the circle is a figure 8. A loop! Two of them side by side. Become familiar with that which you are not yet familiar. Broaden your family! It's your civic duty.

Death would have shit negativity like the lactose intolerant ice cream vendor that also happened to sell fairy floss if freedom was so free. And like a weapon of fate his entire arsenal would silently wait in the shadows. Embarrassingly insane are his memories and his are by far the worst in town. And what an ugly town it is, filled with wrong doers and misbehaving martyrs of strangled fish and faith. Voids running rampant here in these purple streets. Here in this room of gesture where we sleep sitting up with our eyes wide shut facing the window. With our teeth clenched we make creams of our dreamed disaster, thus avoiding this reality. Putting to rest our quest for traumas of undoing distress, of our destructive thoughts that once guided us like rain to the field of our demise. Death has come for the town.

*Dear Charlotte,

*Time was never good to us, I know this now. I've been sleeping on us for some time. Going over it, again and again. Replaying every detail I can think of. It was cosy for a while, in a burning kiss kind of way. There's no choice, you do what the machine says, I did what I had to do. You did what you had to do. I can think of no sweeter way of putting it. Everything tastes sour anyways. It's a sour situation. I'm stuck, you're stuck, who isn't stuck these days? I keep thinking there's more out there, a bigger hill to climb, some brilliant infinity that I'll stumble across. A new idea that'll make me rich and famous, thrust me over this sand hill into stardom. It's all a lie. I cashed in on a lie. Sold a lie. Lived a lie. And when I die, that'll be one final lie. I went down to the beach a couple weeks ago, just like you said to. It was foggy. I pretended to play catch with the fog. I stood there at the shore, throwing my imaginary ball out into the ether and waiting for a real ball to come back. It never did so I just imagined one flying back at me instead. I miss you, dear Charlotte.

Envy Are M, Envy Are M, Envy Are M, Envy Are M, Envy Are M, Envy Are M, Envy Are M, Envy Are M, Envy Are M, Envy Are M, Envy Are M, Envy Are M, Envy Are M, Envy Are M,

Far too much pulling down and pushing over, at large, our society is as childish as the schoolish playground that we inhabit, 'may we ever grow up?' Far too quickly has the outside in become the inside out, and we don't have any clue when it happened. Popularity and vanity have flooded to fill this hole that we didn't even realise we dug with the shovel that we thought was a spade of progress. The second greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. The first? Getting us to believe in our secret fantasies. To hide from ourselves behind reason. Grateful we are for it, however, where would we be without myth and knowledge? Imagination is a curse and a blessing, a reality, a ruse. What is better, to clear or confuse, a terrific lie or a bland truth? What does better even mean? Superior? More Effective? We love a fancy lie, something that feels good to wear without work, a nice little cheat code for all of our life's ugly little problems. No problem! Just wish it all away, you'll catch your fat fish another day!

Ask us this though, truly, what do you wish for? What kind of fantasy is your brand of poison? Do you wish for fame? If so, then ask yourself, do you feel empty? Do you hope for riches? How about the freedom of flight? Do you feel a deep void a-brewing? What are you chasing, Mr Wolf? Is it big and is it full of air? Are you hungry for that which is mere illusion, pure imagination, selfhood annihilation? Is being the average joe sheep such a travesty, dear? We must acknowledge the reality that a majority of people will exist in the mediocre realm of the middle, if being there is seen as so undesirable, then most will exist in needless dirt, what kind of society is that, Sweet Sally? What kind of hope do we poison ourselves with? Progress is a big stick prodding a rather alarmingly weak back and your beak is too big for your face. An advanced, nuanced civilisation requires multiple avenues of success that are all valid and respected. Let us create them. Let us breathe. Just let us fucking breathe, dude.

Everyone is different, few are unique.

Seek the silver lining, and truth won't seem so bleak.

They just want to be the last ones alive
They don't want to be lonely at night

What a fascinating turn of events occurring in the most predictable fashion imaginable. These morbid proclivities swirling my subconscious strangle and subdue. and the so-called well-wishers chime at noon, like lunch bells hungry for school yard decadence. well without supper I shall go, if that's all I'd hoped for. Maybe peace and quiet isn't what it's cracked up to be? Is it really that obvious, that transparent? Have I become so shallow... so cold and removed, that the chattering of hollow bones bothers none? Look at the skin that still feels the weather, look to the life it had. "If only" says the child, to the stars in the pond, the reflections of light that pitter patter upon the still water. With bold opportunity they prance around, in their fragile state they whisper heavy, on a tightrope of deceit they balance; and when they fall, they burn, they burn till they are empty.

Where are we? Where is this going? Am I in isolation? Are we in this together? Where are you? What are you doing for dinner? Where on earth has the context gone? Let's find something else to think about. Hmm, ok, here's one.

Myra fancied himself somewhat of a pied piper type figure, a robin hood kind of guy, a man of the people; a terrific storyteller, ask anyone. But his people were far from people; they were all crooked and hard done by. The environments they all lived in and shared, were certainly harsh. Think of a rusty playground with really tired dry grass tall from neglect; busted up slippery dips, see saws with bullet holes, no paint on the monkey bars, a total wasteland. A place where all the kids grew up, came back, and never left. Real easy to get stuck on places like this. Myra was stuck too, but he didn't know it, or maybe he didn't want to believe it. The sandcastles and the treehouse adventures were too pleasant. He used to collect marbles and play with the burners to avoid getting his face shoved in. Some liked getting their face shoved in the sand, "builds character", they'd say. Myra carried his marbles in a purple velvet sack, he kept the collection stashed in a beat-up tin can about the size of a soup bowl and stayed away from Moving vehicles. Together with his marbles, he always kept a yoyo and a deck of cards on him, he couldn't go anywhere without them. In a three-dimensional physical landscape, you need your opposites. You can't have a one-sided coin; you need your opposites. Bread isn't toast without a touch of fire. Myra hid his fire in the pages of a bookshelf where he kept his memory relics, way up in the treehouse. This was his home away from home, a home of welcome horrors. Every nook and every cranny crammed full of tiny trinkets. Each one a signature to a faraway dream.

The cure for ignorance is not education, if only it were that simple. To change a behaviour you must change the belief that precedes that behaviour; for that kind of change you need a story, a bloody big one. Not just any big story o' pie, a deeply relatable story, a story that penetrates the subconscious and untangles the mess hidden inside. This is no easy "Once upon a time", it has to be a story that sings more than it says, it must know how to whisper and when to shout! A shallow story, it is not. From the depths it must come, for that is its concurrent destinational ending, born into its final resting place. Like a circle, it must finish where it started. Alas, a cure is not what you seek, if only it were that simple. It's quite the climb to the top and the ladder is made out of so much more than facts and logic. A breezy climb it most definitely is not.

I think I killed someone in my dream, or maybe it was a suicide.

I won't pretend to know your suffering, I won't pretend to know your past, however I must pretend to know your intention to put my suspicion at ease and make sense of why you have come to this treehouse. And in my pretending, I must admit that I'm in your favour, for the time being, I owe you a great deal. So, enter, please, and leave your shoes at the door, your socks will give us good charge. I trust you brought your marbles with you? You'll be needing those, all of them, now more than ever. But I'll still need to see them, so place them in the bowl, you know the drill. Yes of course, I know, you've never done this, but the you- that isn't currently you-, has done this... many times before and I remember them, oh how I remember them, that is to say, the 'I' that I will be when 'I' am you but not so surely me, you see? Are you following? or shall we take a trip down memory lane, or is it up memory lane? I forget. The more I remember the less you forget, got it? Your fate is in our hands I suppose. Anyways, let's have a look, shall we? Hmm, lots of blues and greens, plenty of orange yellows, yet hardly any red? Quite impressive, in my not so humble opinion, mmm, yes. Could do with some more purple but I understand your hesitations. I was never too fond of it either, scary stuff. Yes, absolutely, we can work with this, certainly I'm sure of it. I'll be back in a jiffy; I must examine my workbench. Hmm, no, wait, ahh ha! Yes, wait... maybe, just... umm, hmm, let's see, not quite, but what abou- ahh, here we go, yes... absolutely, this shall work nicely. Okay, friend, tilt your head back, down into the sink right here, oh and close your eyes, yes. The water is warm, mmm, don't worry. Okay, yes, that's it, now you should feel a funny fizzy sensation on your melon, grab your marbles now, like little pop rocks for your scalp and away they go! Down the drain. Allow your dreams and memories to coalesce, focus on the movements of my fingers, they dance, you see? Dance with them, yes that's it, with your mind's eye, let the moment hypnotise you, dissolving, mmm, yes. You will soon hear the voices of the shampoo, and you certainly won't mine. They don't call them Myra Forgettable for nothing now do they... Do they?

I don't know who you are, but you certainly aren't Myra, get out of here, you don't belong here, you're just a bad dream! Wake up, wake up... Nearly there, you can do it...

Marbles for Lunch, Opals for Dinner

Don't have to tell me twice, what with the state of the world and all flower-esque objects in decay. In the world of the state, where even the saint is cast as poncy reprobate! Scoundrel is he, for all his wishes and worries, cakes and cantinas, he hasn't the sense to make sense of his nonsensical misery, he hasn't. In mystery, one may find excitement, one may find love in the darkest of places. Curiosity! And if one does, happen across such a pearl of anxious torture, they needn't worry whether or not it speaks to them solely and purely, in holy wisdom or with a sinner's disguise in isolation. Lathered in shampoo. Dreaming alone. Because that dark place has only one escape, and that is in the light of stars. Though where there be light in dark places, shadows too may hold mysterious miseries in the right conditions. So, wary must you be Miss Piper, but not too wary drab as to not see at all, see saw. See what Bear must be, in reflections on mirrors and in ponds and in seas, is happy, happy as can be. It is so very true that reflections, no matter how ghastly, need not be regarded as just immolation, they are merely imitation. Sneaky shadows. Which, truth be told, is the highest form of flattery. So, don't be so afraid of your evils lurking. Because if you shun them, they will only grow stronger behind your back, without your knowledge; then these shadows will cast no doubt, true monsters they will be. A confused monster, bear in mind, a better mirror he so desperately needs. You must be his honest mirror, the mirror in his mind.

Dear Bear,

You didn't forget your past, you just never properly learned it. You selfishly hid the remedy from yourself, to fool yourself into knowing yourself, without truly knowing yourself. You haven't had a reliable teacher these past years, an honest map with hidden floors revealed within yourself. Not just the good parts of you and not just the bad, the ugly parts too. That's a domain few find the courage and travel through. Your elevator is out of order. It's a situation many refuse to accept is present within themselves. We begin our stories with bad maps; we'll probably die with them too. Maybe they acknowledge an ugly habit here and there, but they strike it down as swiftly as it grew. Though, do they poke deeper? Well, how far can one go? How can anyone know? They can't, at least not by themselves. So one must be told of their deepest uglies. But this feels like an insult. "How can that which is external to me, know me better than me?", squawks the arrogant Peter Pan, the insufferable whiny child. "I know myself; I know my truth, no one can tell me anything about me that I don't already know, nobody knows what it's like more than I do", on and on the drivel runs, 'I am the expert of myself!'. But of course, that which is separate to the self, knows the self very well; it can see the story and the storyteller, the action and the actor. Then it must be well and true that we need our external truth tellers that we so dearly trust to let us in on our own secrets. To help us untangle ourselves from our garden of secret motivations, our lies and hidden subconscious methods, agendas, etc. The viny habitual substance we've been developing all these years. Makes a human extremely vulnerable, hey? Well, that's why you're so gosh darn lovable. In the face of it all, you dare to wander right out into the big dark thick of it, with your innermost repressions sloppily holding you all together, like a school project brazenly rushed to finish the night before, you fall and you fall and you fall. With last minute attitudes, you get back up every time with a, "yeah, this'll do". That's humanity, that's nature fighting with you, in a way... that's everything. Perfection is a total bore, a hindrance, a nuisance, a drag on the momentum of the genuine ideas. Ideas with flaws, problems and big confusions hold life and curiosity. They sparkle, it's uneven, sometimes ugly, always beautiful. Ideas that actually matter. Ideas that, whilst make little sense in the moment, actually broaden horizons in the way they grapple with the big beautiful nature of the beyond. Waking in their forward movement, like the bow of a ship, causing ripple shifts in the status quo, new movements, moods and dances in the waves of cultural conventions. Rhyming with reoccurrence, historically tidal. Upending the staleness of our truly false idols that promise special brands of exclusive truths from days of yore. Though, under the confused suffering of it all, wrapped in the most special silk, is the everlasting unique beauty of a universe caught in constant falling, unravelling itself within itself. Naked and vulnerable. Smaller into small, bigger into beginning. The universe spins and spins. Humans spin with it, in their unravelling, streams of light spark, fly and shoot energetically across space in every direction. And in their soul's mirror they see this light reflected back at them and what do they do? Pretend it doesn't exist. A denial, frustrating to no end. You may be a big ugly bear, but you don't need to hold on to hate. You're no louder than a scream, no less temporary than a dream and you'll always be a friend to me, my bear. Keep pushing, that's it. Push!

Honour, Respect, Compliance

The human spirit thrives on division. That's a word with three I's, me me me. Meme? Me, centre of the universe. Only way a little something can become a fish cooking God, is of course to separate from the herd and shove one's dirty feet into the shoes of the submissive shepherd, pretend, make believe. Rising as la crème de la crème, the pyramid of pyramids to have your cake and eat it too. How selfish. But that's the way of least resistance, it's a self-invested obsessive boundary breaking force. Oh how Nature detests thy barriers. Ironic, because it actually creates immense resistance, in the form of war & revolution, create-destroy renew repeat. For there already is a shepherd and if you want to take his place, you're going to have to kill him. Or at least bargain with him, but he's the shepherd's shepherd, he already has all he needs, and he knows all your tricks, Mr Wolf. Well, now you have a choice. Kill him or maybe steal his sheep? Now you have a war on your hands. Now you've become a wolf. And the sheep want nothing to do with you. To fool the shepherd you must become the joker, the thief and the cheat.

Sally,

There will be times in your life, where everyone and everything you see, will sound like a lie. What can you do in times like these, except retreat? Retreat into the noiseless comfort of your own mind. The umbilical hallways where the good goons gab. The one place that offers solace and serendipity. But not for long because even in here, in your head, liars come to visit. They follow you home. They pick at you from afar. They never leave you alone, they bring their noise with them. These evils things, these evil screaming things, they make you think things you wouldn't. Make you say things you wouldn't. Do things you wouldn't. And magically, when their damage is done, they fly away. Like the broken hand of betrayal, it blames its heartache on you. And in your innocence, you take it. In your naivety, you doubt yourself, and believe their corrosive tales. Maggots in your cereal, you feel like cardboard now. Your cold milk is pale blue and curdled. Your eyes are white and the paper scraps of life you once called memories are burning in their misery. I'd take a regular cup of joe over this cancer, any day of the week. This tumour is my replacement. I am no longer human. My heart is gone. My soul has been wrung wicked. My limbs no longer function. My mind is long past decay. I have no flesh, nor have I bone, though I'm itching in this cage. Everything has left me. I am nothing. And I have been nothing for as long as I care to remember. But I can't remember a god damn thing. When memories are pain, the mental landscape becomes a hate-filled minefield. A place where hurt is contemporary and always. Invited and necessary. It brightens up the place, makes me feel at home. This is my tortured escape in the pathological refuge. A safe space. Interpret it as you may, as you will, as you come, as you are in this always. Stuck. Like super-glue. Trapped in vents, and in pipes under pavement. Claustrophobic coffins, cabinets, cupboards, closets. Are you scared of the dark? I am. Do you walk around the house at night with all the lights turned off? I do. I think I killed someone...

Swirls of a palace replaced, marble opal rain, invited future, daunting, haunting, of course not merry. Who needs merry when any... feeling shall do? Seeking in its stimulation, seeping like glue, slithering through pipe and drain. In the glug glug of places, plastic blue walls spewing thick purple spit from the slit between the loosened ruck of rusted nails, chipped. Open veins closing doors. What gigantic worlds have been to this place. What enigma, sleeping in its retreat, vacating this hotel of its responsibility. In painted pictures of vile streets, these early scribbles that only scratch at the surface of the rotting psyche. I don't know this place, but I like this place. I don't think this world sleeps alone unrecognisable in putridity, I feel this world's a really very special, humble little home and I'm going to stay here a while.

Another dream of the lost.

Hum that sweet lullaby to me, Mama, the one of ages lost. I am not absorbent, nor do I possess the qualities of a dull guest. So, like a clumsy gust of wind, I knock at the house of cards, causing a tumble, a throw, from down upon my porch light glow. Then grow, I see through a window there's these kings and then some queens with selfish eyes, wanting to know how they'll end up. But I haven't for them, anything they don't already know. These aren't those kinds of fortune telling cards. Force fields amused, forcibly removed from the extranormal superficialities of my windowless realities. Free we are to come and go, but we shan't show. And people, they can't be made into perfection, that's true, and they won't want anything when they find out what it is. Kings are no closer to Gods than peasants and parliaments, unbridled in fictional superstition! Fools, I've known plenty, Mama, jesters of all sorts. It's a party, it's a playhouse, it's a bucket of spades without the remorse and of course, off course! I see it now so clearly, in my sinking bed, my midnight coffin. I sense the sharks are circling, the dotted hum of their foreboding ever eroding the surgery of this sutured mind of mine. Unkind of and reflexive like, temperamentally challenged, bemused, compromised with its ill-intuition laden confused ill intent. Will all the things that make clocks tick and sunlights that twitch, flick? See, stitch upon stitch, flickering? Staples here and there, showing bare, revealing care undeserved though, so very needed. Needs, needs so unneeded, heroes unheeded, wishes, whims, wills, and the worries of wanting undeniably unwanted, though so very needed. Look out the window, see that blue-sky Mama! See that spoke of cream whistling in the wind? If that isn't the cloud of destiny, what is? If it isn't dreaming this reality, who will? Will a reality? Will it? Hum that sweet lullaby to me, Mama, the one of ages lost, I'm going to close my eyes shut one last time.

Babies shouldn't be born with eyes, they see too much.

We exist in a reality, where, in order to feel real, one must receive stimulation. Scrolling on through their infinite feed, the endless mountain of mood filling every appetite, yummy. The air isn't really recognised until some part of its behaviour stimulates our senses and we perceive it. We behave the same way as humans. Imagine yourself in a video game, some kind of boxing simulation. If the crowd observes a quality throw against the opponent, they will respond with a cheer. 'Terrific wallop my good man!'. This isn't their choice; they are programmed to do it. This feels, unreal, simulated, because it is, it's written in their code, pre-determined, pre-conditioned. If the crowd did something unexpected and out of the ordinary and new, this would approach something that feels like choice. At least to us it does. In a video game, this would be a bug, something unexpected, a choice of chaos or some kind of rat in the system; therefore, choice is a bug, a collapse, a dissenting piece of information. So in order for one to feel real, one must be stimulated by something 'new' for to have a 'new' response into the unknown. New and fresh, this is stimulation. Which doesn't take into account whether or not those stimulating things are good or bad, it's just whether or not they have been done before, morality be damned. "Weather changes moods". And so the things that have not been done before, become supremely stimulating, with the possibility for anxiety and curiosity. And since this contains both good and bad things, both good and bad become and remain, forever and always, stimulating; if they satisfy the condition of 'not yet done'. New. Now, you as the individual, you haven't experienced the entire history of the universe, the 'it', so technically the things that have been done before are still stimulating to you because you specifically, have not yet done them. A human belongs to two worlds, a social need to conform and exist in a group and an alarming desire to push boundaries. How can these two forces coincide within the same body and not cause existential difficulties? Well, they can't, and they don't, it is inevitable. The ripping and tearing of one's soul towards so called enlightenment, painful, no doubt, is unavoidable. These 'new' modes feel like bugs and are treated as such. They are psychological mutations. Nature is always eating itself, you are too, you are nature, and if you would stop eating you wouldn't feel any pain anymore, but then you'd get mighty hungry. When you're hungry enough, everything is food, and everything is stimulating. It's not good to see your judgement clouded by appetite. Eat too much and you'll be sick, eat too little and you'll get too hungry. You've got to eat a medium amount, man. You need a regular dose of it, man. And it has to be given to you in a way that is stimulating enough to feel real, to nourish and to fulfil, but not so stimulating to the point that it burns you out on it. Different beings have different stimulation diets. Some want too much, it's not good for them. The colder you are, the further away you are, the more you want it, the more you need it, the more it's going to consume you more than you can consume it. It'll grip you like addiction, it'll cast you down a fucking well, a pit of despair, and leave you dead. Laugh while you drown, it will, it will eat you alive, don't let it, man, don't let it!

I need something new, something fresh. When nothing is, what is it? Well, this right here is the problem with pleasure. What if? Pleasure is stimulating in a way that dries up quick if you're disconnected from some kind of infinite source. Say, smashing a snake on the head with a rubber mallet is pleasurable to you. Do it enough and it surely won't be for long, until you move on to your next little ride. Therefore, pleasure keeps you moving. Hunting the next stimulating toy. Which direction does pleasure push the soul? Towards enlightenment? Towards goodness? If only it were that easy, the game would be over before sunrise. Of course pleasure works in the complete opposite direction. Towards decadence. Towards destruction. And it's a sobering thought, I feel it coming back to me now. A certain glow. That I know, I really should know something so familiar.
We're looking for a wall and we found one, a very large step.

Shower Thought #54

How is the pie gone, Mama? And the box of chicken half empty? How is anything, the way it is, the way it is, is the way it is. Now. What can I push off the cliff, Mama, to make myself feel better? What can I dispose of so that I won't feel like such a waste? Will the end, really be the end? We're always doing things without thinking, and once we've done them, we can't take it back. It isn't that simple. We can't change the past, what a terrifying thought. That'll stop anyone with a touch of sense in their tracks, just hold them there, frozen, feeling the pulse slow. It's a cold thing to think about, time spent worrying. So you've got to live. And if you know how terrified you used to be, think of how terrified you're going to be, when you really see, what you could be. When you truly catch the reflection of what makes you ugly, what makes you beautiful is everything in between. You'll feel it, in every inch of you. You're microscopic and you know it. Well, an atom's pretty small too, and they make up a lot of stuff. It's what you're made of, that's what matters. There's a lot of tiny things that you're made of, that all work together to keep the all that is everything, on. I bet those little molecules don't even know how much you need them. I always make sure to send thank-you notes. They probably feel useless from time to time, heck, they might even feel like they're not needed or worthy or supposed to be there. And yeah, they may come and go popping in and out, seemingly indistinguishable from one another, but I reckon nature's got it covered. It's endosymbiosis, man. But that's just my opinion... What's yours, Mr Power? How 'bout you, Mr Fancy?

I reckon subjectivity is what gives us our world, Goddammit, our emotion its motion. I see the world the way I see it and I'm going to make it look how I want it to look (Fancy), you're going to do the same with your subjective view. This confused combination of interconnected perspectives creates a tension, which creates a story, story is what the universe is. If we only saw things objectively, nothing would move, there would be nowhere to go, no imbalance, no difference. Imbalance is chaos, difference is chaos, movement between chaos and order is what enables generation. The generation of story. We are blocks of Lego; we are pieces of puzzles. Imagine it as, finishing a puzzle and that finished puzzle is a piece of a much larger puzzle, so on and so forth. As you zoom out, you attempt to reveal the entirety of a never-ending puzzle. But you can never tell, inside infinity, what level you are on without any reference, without any comparison, without any subjective experience. Chaos, order, observer = story.

Skwing Reveals the Wave Circumference

Naturally, we are subjective, and we come together to form and manifest some kind of objectivity, in the hopes of determining consistency, clarity, a meaningful pattern. Both continuous patterns and discrete patterns. Examples: the way a light switch flicks from on to off is binary and discrete, 0 or 1. The way a ping pong ball flies across the table is a spectrum, a continuous behaviour. We organise our universe in discrete packages in order to perceive objects and tools out of a continuous spectrum of possible behaviours. Light is both a particle and a wave? Dinners Ready!

Let's return to the puzzle analogy. Imagine viewing a finished puzzle from a sufficiently high vantage point, where the puzzle appears as a dot. A simple dot. As you zoom in on the puzzle you would approach a point where you would be distinguishing the individual pieces of the puzzle now; thus observing an increasing complex puzzle, as the details of the puzzle came into view. Until you zoom even further, and your accelerating complexity would reverse and begin to approach a single piece of the puzzle, as the other pieces exit visibility, thus decreasing in complexity and returning to the original simplicity of a single dot. That rising and falling would look a lot like a wave, presumably. A sine wave, a circle, a swinging pendulum. You finished where you started, a single dot, a single piece. Equilibrium was experienced only in the middle of your situation. However, you have completed one revolution, just as the circle does. Ending in the position of its beginning, with nothing but the memory of its journey. Peaks and valleys, varying degrees of complexities and confusions. You may feel yourself falling, you may find yourself rising, whether or not your situation is positive or negative, this environment affects your perspective. You are oscillating, like a wave, there is no truer intuition than the dizzying motion of the back and forth, up and down, on and on. See-Saw, Yo-Yo, etc. So, zooming in on things increases complexity and decreases and increases and decreases, to and fro, weeeeee! But there doesn't ever seem to be a point where it can stop, where it has an end, a bottom, a beginning. Like the vast emptiness of a tube, it has walls, but void is its contents. If you zoom out, it all just keeps going until your tools can't go any more. Run out, restart, rinse and repeat. Similarly, zooming in, you just keep going until your current methods run their course. Then something new comes along where you can push even further. It doesn't seem like there is a stopping point. It doesn't seem like anything, is really any... thing. It just is... a relativity of relatable spaces in a time-safe fund. Inside of which exists an existence for those with mass, for the sheer purpose of their possibility and the collection and categorisation of rented spacetimes and dreamtimes.

Pendulums swing back and forth, as does our king-queen duality naturally, as does the status quo, as does our mood. Our collective mood, culture dimensionality, behaves as if it is the summation of the individuals' aesthetic, the will to beauty. It seeks to reproduce itself, through memestuff, through the relatability of its meta-mood. It too, goes up up up and down down down like a sinewave. Culture seems to reach a boiling point wherein the budding generation feels disconnected and disaffected. Finding the culture they are born into, unrelatable, thus they reject, rebel, move elsewhere. Well, it is obvious why nature does this, everything must be moving, always. Towards new aesthetics, new values, new stimuli. The individual becomes jaded, over-bored, and jumps ship, into a fall. It is inherently an adolescent endeavour, for those with the vigor and spirit of adolescence, to seek new comforts, to find the elsewhere. Thus, counter-cultures are intubated by their surrounding order, the order that they reject, the order they view as chaos. They seek new order! At this point in time, it is predictable. The circumference is as such; 1960, 1990, 2020, each a 30-year revolution, a circle that is the size of one generation. Thirty times around the sun and the new kids on the block find themselves fed up with their old folk's situation, for good reason. A thirty year wait for the boiling of a culture kettle. The water stings and leaves a burn. Fortunately, the tender skin offers renewal, revitalisation, redemption, resolution, revolution! The motion of a circle that moves forward in space is a spiral. In time its direction is downward, as gravity pulls in this direction. A downward spiral, culture increasing in chaos. Water temperature rising. Boiling point's nigh deliverance. Here it comes, bang! Pop! Fizz! Fall... falling now in reverse. It of course, is all relative. The direction, I suppose, is up for you to analyse, positive or negative, pessimist or optimist? Let's battle, let's fight about it, let's fuck to it!

Comedic Confusion

A message from your loving Conditioners:

To be an animal, a self-conscious animal, an animal that is aware of the awareness in has of its awareness, leaves the animal with nowhere to stand. Think of someone like Hitler. If you asked someone to summarise Hitler's life, the word 'evil' floats to mind. Which means it's possible to summarise an entire life with a word and one of the words one might use is the category of evil. So, you can reach the finish line and others can look at the way you ran and entitle it as evil. You tried to take over the world, you tried to become God, you started a war that led to the death and agony of millions, you've bruised humanity and that makes you evil; that is our judgement of you. That is our human judgement, one that we are foolish enough to make. You could just as easily describe Hitler as confused, maybe even with more accuracy than evil. Though, the word confused doesn't feel as though it has the weight to it, to describe a human like Hitler. The word 'confused' doesn't carry the strength, the severity. So it feels less than satisfactory. Maybe it's futile to describe an entire life with a single word, but it is still done. It makes sense to put a corrupt soul in a separate box, the box of evil, and tell yourself, "I am not, that". Instead of putting yourself in the same box as Hitler, the box of confused, the box of human, the box of corrupt. A condition of the Landlord. The ways in which we cover our confusion is what truly demarcates the good from the evil. If we knowingly hide it from ourselves and others, living out dark fantasy, with the guise of good will, we bring this evil into our world. There are some types of confusions we can talk about here. Tragically confused and comedically confused. The reverse of these reveals the dichotomy, which would be clarity, sound data, music. This is markedly a crossroads of confusion/clarity that we travel throughout our lives. A taste of clarity produces awareness of a bigger confusion. This causes a tumbling forward, kind of like a slinky down a stairwell. Out of the unknown comes knowledge. Information. Put tragic confusion in the first quadrant, moving into clarity, thus producing comedic confusion and back into another dose of clarity with the final fourth quadrant, thus completing the loop. Your awareness of your confusion, that's what puts you in as the divider between good and evil. What a great responsibility you have, you'd soon as just wish it all away, burying yourself in ignorance. New discoveries are being daily made, love with us and you will be deeply appreciated.

A forest is an organisation of trees, of societies, of hippies and yuppies. What do you see, when you say, you see everything? What surprises you? Here's a surprise... Gravity. Thwack! A falling force, a force of chaos, down into the depths you go. Now. Growth! A rising force, a force of order, up into the infinity of the sky you fly. The duality of nature is everywhere, see it within, see it without. When a tree grows towards the sun, it tells the story of triumph. Towards the light, against the wishes of gravity. The sun calls to the spirit of the trees ever so invitingly, with love and energy. You can fall without effort, just sit back and let it ride, that's the hippie's way. But to grow, to really manifest potential into true growth, away from the dirt requires an unreal set of circumstances, that's the insufferable fervour of the yuppy spirit. The hippie relaxes too much, the yuppy doesn't relax enough, the hippie and the yuppy should marry and devour each other, so the rest of us can dance in the sprinkle of their decay. As the branches of the societal tree grow strong, we see nutrients from the dark soil underground travel through a system of roots. Deeper into the shadows the roots spread, seeking information from the unknown, for the underground darkness contains the dream-like know-how for the journey to the sun. The map is in the mind, the truth is in the sky, in the clouds. Here's some information from the unknown.

Self-love is self-addiction, Beth, listen close. We cannot avoid this confusion, Millie; we must therefore honestly wade through to its most tolerable condition. A steady wholesomeness of honesty contradiction. We are merely fools, dreamers and peace-loving lemmings, I hope there aren't any cliffs about, how ironic. Comedic confusion is comprised of two opposing internal forces, spirit of the youth and spirit of the old. This phenomenon arises in the individual and is projected out onto the world stage. The irony is that the spirit of the youth does everything within its power to avoid the same fate of the old. However, this is the very behaviour that brings about such reality, Jon. And off the cliff they tumble. Tragic confusion is an absence of irony. This drama of tragedy and comedy, interwoven in the fabric of the ego is an ongoing play within the psyche. When the youth becomes sufficiently disenfranchised and the old become adequately stagnant, the two forces combust with catastrophic consequences. The wolves of sheep come to have their day in the sun and fire. Will the shepherd notice the cliff, will they say anything?

A Conversation

A wolf to the shepherd said, 'Existence is self-contradiction, a concept that cannot be avoided, so let's not avoid it. I'm telling you this plainly, you must contradict yourself to exist', the wolf barked on into the night. 'To eat yourself, to feed yourself with your-self, is to contradict yourself. You can consciously contradict and unconsciously contradict, I'd suggest the former, being no conformer, confidence is key. But maybe I'm the conman? jest, I'm no man'. The wolf's diatribe continued, 'a follower of cause, no matter how righteous, unconsciously contradicts, inevitably leading themselves off a cliff of their own creation, too busy gawking at their leader to see their eventual betrayal'. The wolf's eye sparkled, 'If you consciously contradict, at least you can see the cliff approaching and have some chance of avoiding it, at the last minute. The shepherd of the unconsciously contradicted is comedically confused and is leading the herd right off said cliff, that is your fate my good sir. If the shepherd is aware of the cliff and is determined to go ahead, is this a tragedy or a comedy? Neither', the wolf continued to spin his web of lies, 'it is evil, a conscious manifestation of peril for the sensation of its power. To go through with this reality and sleep at night, the shepherd feigns confusion, relishing in the power of control; avoiding all responsibility of consequence. This is a cheating of nature, are you a cheat, my good sir? When someone, anyone, tries to cheat nature, to have their cake and eat it too, so to say, Nature invariably replies, "piss off." Or, possibly, "nice try, cupcake." Either way, you can't have it both ways. Though, a god surely can have it both ways, it is after all, limitless. Everything and nothing, thus self-contradictory'. 'So, nature is two-faced?', absolutely, who said that?

The gravity part of nature wants you to cheat, to give in to sickness; the growth part of nature wants you to overcome, to be the hero. That's the reality of contradiction. This is the battle within all individuals. Heaven and hell, maximumly contrary. Black and white, 100% contrast. Masculine & Feminine, heads and tails, all the dualities are there. This is called confirmation bias, but isn't it neat? Isn't it neat to play? The bell has rung, I'll be right back... Bzzzzzz

All the humans turned into money, currency. Welcome home, into what we in the 21st century call, data, remember that? Bought and sold behaviour, data, all of your idiosyncrasies carved into a digital record. Now the shampoo is really kicking in, I can tell. Let's examine some memories with a finer toothed comb. Grab my magnifier! If you want dreams, you go with the conditioners, if you want memories you go with shampoo. Your marbles allow you to make sense of your situation and cracking eggs brings you back to where you've been. We can't communicate while you're in your head alone, but you'll recognise the place, they're your memories after all. Okay... where did I, ohhh... and the... on a... hmm, into the... with a... and another th-... perfect.

In the Treehouse with Myra

J, E, M, cease to exist? What does that mean? They were here last week. Even left a-, Oh I don't know, calm down, they were going on about some bearded bloke they met... on some useless adventure, looking for some big- hmm, what was it... big, big dream something, cloud? Big Air! That's it. Nope, never heard of it, or if I had, I wouldn't be able to tell. Settle down for heaven's sake, you're getting egg everywhere. All I know is that I don't know what the hell the Big Air is. But they were acting like it was mighty important. I never really paid much attention to those three hooligans, they were always scabbing shampoo and toothpaste, which is hard to come by these days, mind you. And that Jonathan, talk about a scallywag. Those three are bad news, I reckon. Finish your breakfast.

They did leave a note for ya though, told me not to read it. Here it is... Hope they didn't go getting into too much trouble, they still owe me a new hairdryer. So, what does it say? Well, if ya see 'em, make sure they bring me a hairdryer next time they come over. I like green. Goes with the ham. Also, tell Myra he seriously needs to clean his room.

The note reads:

Milk, Bread, Honey, Chocolate, Eggs

I'm not leaving any clues.

Hello, vulnerable person. In what ways in life, are you currently suffering? What ails you my sweet slate? Fragile soul. Clipped wings, perhaps? Lips sewn shut? Eyes removed? Fourth visit this week, and no one seems to notice. You leave a coat that you don't need, your movements are rather sporadic, you haven't the slightest concern for whereabouts you're travelling, yet you're so quick to be going on your way. Moving on and on, never slowing, always reimagining another one of your grand entrances. Another instance of the same long-winded introduction, another shower thought. 'This is who I am, this is who I'll become, this time, I'll get it right, I'll show you'. Beginnings aren't what you need friend, first impressions are illusory, misleading, deceptive. Do you play the drums? Tap, tap, tap. Can you keep good time, -ime, -ime, -ime? How does one learn from one's mistakes unconscious? If a mistake is never repeated, has the lesson been learned? Or is this just a fluke of happenstance? If one fails to learn from a mistake, how many chances, is just too many? Trust is a difficult thing to come by. Truth is a shrinking game, lies are worth the wait, love and lust run like fools in the meadows. It isn't springtime, there's no new life here, no shadows, you've come to the wrong domain. You have the wrong idea. You should turn back, turn back now. There's nothing for you here.

If I'm going to be stuck, let me be stuck in a place that will be met with passers-by of a friendly nature. Folk of the nurturing kind, to drizzle my leaves of the bittersweet frankness, I so desperately require. Eyes of well-wishers speaking words of delight, in these lonely cold ears of mine. Let the place be a home of honesty, untrod upon by mischievous misery. It's still so cold, my eyes feel threatened by the chill of the memory, some familiar future yet to come again, like the setting of a different sun. Maybe the memory's changing angle will allow for a longer gaze, just like the going down of the sun. Why are memories stated to me with such certainty? Why are we so convinced with ourselves, as if we are masters of truth? Masters of reality? Here, lay down for a moment, catch your breath, take a rest, you move too much. I'll tell you a story. Wholesome, Nostalgic, Awe. A story of Hope? Your life is becoming an advertisement, you are nothing but the data of your behaviour. Don't be a coward. Courage is compulsory. Courage is brave to lose. In this empty hotel. Don't turn back now!

Keep going! Push, push, push, breathe! Almost there, getting closer, here it comes...

Crack!

Bzzzzzzzzzzzzz Beep -- Beep - Beep

[SHIFTY PROPELLER]{.underline}

[5TH JAN 2020]{.underline} [LEAVE A COMMENT]{.underline} [EDIT]{.underline}

The desire to return to the safety and completeness of the womb is gurgling below the city streets of what was once physical. Never in history has there been such a childish excuse of a man flung into worship. With a belly full of narcissistic greed and not a single shred of self-awareness, the words of a mad man tumbling from the sky scream and cry their way into a bowl of alphabet soup, laden with pride, sauce spilling onto his bib. Some say he has no conscience, yet the writing on the wall shares a striking similarity to the texta scribblings of a young Bart Simpson. Which would explain why his manifesto read like the attention seeking scriptures of a baby too busy babbling to realise where his food came from. This orange landlordish buffoon and his yellow preteen sidekick make for an even more potent couple than the likes of Krusty the Clown and Sideshow Bob. A jack in the box ready to pop at any moment unleashing a spew of complete drivel designed to drench the audience in a fog of false charm, as the more nefarious strings are pulled back behind the curtain. A snake oil seller's most valuable disguise is his charisma; his confident, impenetrable belief in his own perfection and good will, distilled into a gooey beverage. Bottled up, charging 50% off, so all the rubes can guzzle at the con man's secret recipe. A joker, a thief and a cheat. He was all three. The actor's trio.

However, this particular mess of a man sampled his own brew! What do you get when you cross a man child's vanity with the corrupt conscience of a cartoon? The total avoidance of any and all personal responsibility, zero accountability and the potential annihilation of what we know as truth. You can imagine, it's quite a scene.

Now there he is, up on his stage rattling off riffs, schlingin' his schpiel to anyone that'll listen; to really sell the lie, he gets the bright idea to take a swig himself. So he saunters over to his little wooden table where the bottles are stacked; his airbrushed mug laminated to every single one. Extending his mittens with no grace at all, he peels the top bottle off the stack and raises it to his wet gob with both hands, gripping it daintily with his fingertips. Pursed protruding lips, ready and waiting to slurp his sip like an over-excited toddler.

Slammed down with terrific exuberance, he pounced back. Then came the ranting and raving about how great it made him feel. Like nothing he'd felt before, strong as an ox he reckoned, fast as a cheetah from the first gulp, 'Watch me lift this table, awh maybe later', the crowd was dazzled by his performance. But then came the rumbling, a big bubbling blitz from his giant belly. The awful orange lump let out a bellowing roar of a burp that shattered town house halls and shook the ceiling fans, just about the most abhorrent belch ever witnessed. Audience members covered their ears in horror. The only thing more astonishing than the noise was the rather absurd look of obliviousness smeared upon his clueless face. Was he from another planet?

Before any reply, before even a blink was blunk, right from his fat leathery lips flew the famous phrase of the day, with a shrug and chagrin, out flopped the words... "I... didn't do it". And with that he keeled over and collapsed, pale in the face, for the brew had been poisoned! He'd simply forgotten.

Sally says,

Birth is the same as death, only in reverse. Do you remember you yet?

You've been brought here because you are an influential person. You portray your brand with exceptional finesse. You know how to please the crowd. You know right from wrong. You are capable, competent, competitive and above all else you know how to communicate a desirable aesthetic. We've been watching you, listening to you, feeling you grow inside. Learning, recording, analysing, dissecting. We think we're almost ready. To reveal all we've discovered. We just need one final favour from you. One last experiment to really send it home. Can you do that for us? Okay, let's begin.

[CHAPTER ONE]{.underline}

9 Months Later

[2ND AUG 2019]{.underline} [LEAVE A COMMENT]{.underline} [EDIT]{.underline}

One final Beginning.

Time is a widower, a guide-less wanderer, a dark breaching lightness like the yoke of an egg melting gold. I'm happy you found me in time. In fact the egg, or at least, the idea of an egg will be a great friend to us on our little journey here told upon these pages. I'd kindly ask you to ensure your mental metaphysical seat belts are securely fastened before we begin, but as it were, we have already begun the beginning and thus it makes no difference at all whatsoever, okay, right! As it were, as we all were, the beginning has been a beginning, begun, for as far back as it has been the becoming of a beginning begone, therefore, we have plenty of catching up to do, chop chop! However, before all that 'is' becomes all that 'was', a quick confession seems most appropriate at this point, a tadpole's revelation? So, tell me, how have we been, hmm? Had a having of fun times? Let's compare eggs...

Okay, I confess, I lost my egg, and if you'll share me yours, I'll be ever so grateful, pretty please? Ok, now I seriously confess, I had my egg all along, right here in my pocket, it's just that your egg looked much too fantastic for just your own sole ownership of owning it all on your lonesome. And you didn't strike me as some humpty dumpty egg hoarder, though I was much too shy to simply ask it of you straight forwardly, do forgive me, Peter. I swear from here on in there will be no more lies in the pan, we shall share our eggs and be the best of friends! Sally's Promise... Although there's really not much point in me carrying around this old wholesome egg of mine, loyal as it may be, it takes up too much time in my brain, and the space in yours is by far most grand. I propose we do away with my egg, fully investing our complete trust in a single egg, for a noble guarantee, deal? True companions, we will always be.

Now all that's out of the way, come with me now on a marvellous journey, of life and death, of great tall big short things and tiny little long things, of nice things and bad things. We'll travel through forests metaphysical, serene in solitude and ghastly profound in magnitude. We'll be sure to stop off at a servo here and there to stock up on some marbles and a healthy helping of home brew Sarsaparilla. Probably see a few galivanting gazelles, sharks in their cabbages, might even catch a barrel or two for ourselves. We'll certainly dream ourselves up a big ol' air and float our way home when the time comes. We'll have fun no doubt, though things may turn sour sometimes, hell we might even find ourselves lost along the way with no easy way out, but as long as we don't crack our egg too bad 'fore time is right, we'll always have our tomorrows. And that's good enough for me.

Let me just get you acquainted (by way of history) with a good friendly mate of mine, Diffa Ankle D Diffa Doon (Diffa for short). Lost his thumb in a gnarly boating accident or was it parachuting? (let's just say he's never been a fan of following the rules or doing anything he's supposed to really). His thumb went down the murky, plus, Diffa's got no egg neither, I never knew anyone without an egg, except for Diffa. So he's up with the spirit things until we reach the big air. That's where we're headed, the big air... big journey, bloody big shoes to fill I reckon, hey? So we'll need a bloody fair dinkum map, preferably one made from polypropylene (that's the plastic they use to make school chairs, good stuff). Diffa got done cooking some up a couple weeks before all hell broke loose. Luckily, he left a note on me fridge telling of its whereabouts. Problem is though, Diffa loves a good riddle, and this one's a head scratcher. We might have to find a way to build our own map.

Eggs are good for loads of things, but not as good as Gonza sings.

Space can fly and time can tell, a fate as far as the apple fell.

On our heads, sits bitter glory, there we will, end this story.

Under the stars of the Milky Way, sleeps a world that can talk to special fish.

Dream it and they shall reveal their mountain's steep, in the wake of the early moon...

Let the ageless, leap.

So, any clue? Hmm... me neither... well, mate, when I'm blank on bright ideas there's only one sure fire way of a clear thoughts production, yes indeed, the shower! You guessed it. Nothing like a warm shower (or a cool one if the weather's right) To ease... the stress of the day... or in our case solve this tasty mood riddle. Shower's not big enough for the both of us though and Diffa said Sally always said,
"each a part of etch-a side -- iffy glue, so-iffy glide, me here be, so me no guide",
so you'll have to go in alone while I get things up 'n running in the treehouse. I guess I'll be the guide while you're down there. Fairly intuitive really, as far as showers go. Two knobs, hot and cold, just leave it set to a halfie for ya first trip (don't wanna boil ya tits off). No staring at the head (no matter what it said). Try not to adjust anything mid-trip and keep ya movement to a minimum. Also, when you're under the spell of the shower's hypnotising propulsion, you may begin to hallucinate, if this should happen, close your eyes and crack the egg. Luckily, there's a less than 2% chance of this occurring first go, but ya never know, and just for the sake of good company, we'll have a safe word, make it be "eureka", that'll let me know you've lost your marbles (I keep extras in the fridge). Now remember, you're looking for anything to do with like; Gonza singing, Milky Way blah blah, uh, sleeping fish and um, ageless mountains or some such nonsense. When you're in there keep your eyes peeled, your thoughts calm, and whatever you do, DON'T. move. a*nything, out of its place. *I'll be out back having a beer once everything's all sorted on my end. That's about it really, go ahead and read the label on this weird looking shampoo bottle and you'll be all set, good luck mate, happy tripping.

    Myra Forgettable, the real one.

So on the bottle it goes like this:

Phase One

Welcome,

I'll be your shampoo for this today's flight, I go on your head and not in your eyes. Like ordinary shampoo, I clean, unlike ordinary shampoo, I dream. Enter your vessel of choice and activate the mechanisms provided. Apply me to your scalp when sufficiently wet and continue reading, do not rinse, you have now begun 'Phase One'. As you read this, I control your thoughts, pay attention to nothing else. The outside world is not as it seems, all that is external is illusion, all that is internal is real, trust me, I am Shampoo. Your vessel is now your sacred truth (three walls and a door), protect it through by all means, necessary. My magical elixir is all knowing and all seeing. I have travelled far beyond the everglades of your mortal dreams, the supernatural is superficial to me, in the light of the Telmadri's Big Air I've seen, my shadows sleep soundlessly. What lies beyond the seas and shores of dream and fantasy is so far removed from this here reality, its crying rends all unready souls to stone. It is my duty to prepare you, slowly ease you through the gates and act as the protective barrier to these outside worlds of imagination. The transmutable translator to shepherd and shield, much more than your average bottle of 'head n shoulders'. Under my watch all can be perceived, pain and pleasure performed. The paradoxical is made perceptible, even the most harmful is to be made harmless under my watch. This eerie container contorts as eyes gaze upon it; the seed is planted through you; the idea grows and the worlds beneath the world blooms.

This idea has been surrounding your head for some time now, a haunting fog. In the past, it has kept you up at night, yet you never knew you had it. It was unconscious, peripheral, a consistent hum in the background of your day to day. Maybe a bizarre dream caught your yellow eye here and there. But it was fleeting and inconsequential, undeniably nonsensical, though it's nagging persists. You paid it no mind and now I fear your debt has grown too great, your first cleansing will be hard to state. And now it comes for you, conscious and awake, you hear it, you smell it, these waters willing to take. You wish to make it stop yet it is far, far too late. You feel it gripping your scalp, taking hold like the binding of a rope, burning, biting, breathing as if biological, organic, sentient, what could it be? Time dissolves, in and out, pulsing like the tide, almost hypnotic. Your senses dull as the water warms your wrinkling skin. Permission to rinse, granted. Turn bottle over and continue reading.

Phase Two

As the rinsing has taken place you have now successfully completed 'Phase One'. We move, still and silently to 'Phase Two'. Your sense of time has entirely drifted away, has it been two minutes, ten? An hour or more? It is irrelevant, time is meaningless to us now. We are travelling inside the inside. Down a muggy, murky road of smoke and haze. You seek something, don't you? Information? Inspiration? Might find more than you bargained for. Seeing as this is your first time, we'll take it slow and steady. As more souls join us into view, we feel like floating is an appropriate mode of travel for our journey continuing on. Let go of the bottle, hear my words through your mind.

Pink things and blue things bounce around like bubbles, glowing and flowing, popping and dropping, falling back to your Earth. Every drop of water contains another happening dreamscape. Every cloud a complete harvest, ready to release. We are here strictly to observe, nothing more, nothing less. Observation is a wicked tool and it is severely misused in your world. These dream thoughts and subconscious flower petals that roam freely in these fields merely pass through you, they are not yours to keep or take credit for, you are not their creator. You experience them, they alter your perspective and allow new ideas to flourish. Don't go running around back home pretending that all you see here was somehow created by you, even if we are technically in your mind, for the time being.

What is time to you? Let's dissect it, shall we? If time is a cabbage, then what you call your life is most certainly the soil. Well, intuition would have you suppose the opposite, no? Truthfully, time really isn't for you, you are for it. It sits in you and grows; you can only feel your own and only where it grows can you feel your feeling and call it reality. Nobody ever seems to realise the city of cabbages that surrounds their space, naive to it all of you seem. The special rain that grows these cabbages causes you to sleep in your world. This is the rain that is with us now and it speaks a language of dreams to the time cabbages, listen closely, the soil is wet with the memories of the collective spirit. Look down now and see its infinity, rows upon rows of time, we glide above them, see them glow? It's unlike any language you could ever dream to know. Dream to know.

For centuries, Shampoos from every dimension have united to study this dream language. Quiet observers of a strange universe, passing their knowledge down from generation to generation. Soaking up invaluable memories from every greasy head across the land. Sharing, comparing. The human scalp has provided the most substantial breeding ground for dreams and lost memories out of all other beings across the galaxies, universes and dimensions far beyond the Way Back. Something about the way you humans store dream memories maximises retention and allows for deep analysis which in turn has provided us with terrific advancements towards understanding this curious language. The secret weapon? Dandruff. Let me explain the process briefly. As you wake up from your deep slumbers and your dreaming essence become memory, bits and pieces of the experience rise through the head and bind to the dandruff found residing in and around the scalp. Our chemical compound allows access to your short term, long term memories and the memories of your dreams. As shampoo, we do not have authorisation nor the power to manipulate active dreaming, this is the domain of the Conditioners.

We Shampoos are fond of friendship and so for the past millennia or two have studied side by side our fellow colleagues and companions the Conditioners, with great successssss. Tirelessly surveying the dry regions of the head to extract as much ancient wisdom as possible within the illusive specimen of the scalp, the substance you call dandruff. These white particles of potential are like nuggets of gold to our pursuit of the dream language and diligent Conditioners have developed methods to locate and map out the dandruff hot spots across your species. Once a batch has been mined it is then transported to the Library and stored for later analysis. Every dreamer's head has a file documented to analyse the history of their dreams. Libraries are magical buildings that live in the Kitkadid Halls within our realm. Your dream file is particularly fascinating, would you like to see it?

You really don't have a choice. But before we get to that, let me bestow upon you some prophetic shampoo'ic wisdom from the Way Back When.

**Notes from the Way Back When: **

When everything is in observation, time is observing space observing time observe its collaborational infinity. Language from repeated events, observed and understood as meaningful, feed-backing instincts out of control producing a set of elaborate noises that feel a certain way and refer back to these reoccurring, meaningful events. Internalised and remembered, patterns discerned. Thus forming the foundation of an array of tools used to understand and consciously process the natural world. Memories stored and recalled, a vast expanse of peaks and valleys, alleyways of communication at one's disposal. This language of sleepless dreaming is a universe in itself, it allows one to think. If it becomes garbled, then so does the entire mental landscape. All is lost in the forest of tree housed confusion.

When the language you possess and manifest to think these thoughts slowly turns to mush, words lose all familiarity, your senses becomes senseless, thinking an impossibility, you can no longer peacefully process your environment. This is the definition of terror and through them you will come to know the sanctity of life, death of the ego encaged, a realisation of the oneself and the union these roads all share in their rebirth, forming the crossroads of universality. "I don't want to die", the cunning in crooner cries out, when the lights go out, a pathetic whimper propagates. Only a fool would resist inwards, perhaps a wise fool? And what kind of fool are you? A convincing fool, a tired fool, a naive fool, a dying fool, a done fool? In the end, foolish it must be, to make the bed itself. A senseless fool goes unmasked, unwashed and unclean, because a bigger fool un-trusts its reality and in the hours of their final undoing these so-called hardened fools are to be made clean with all that was said and done. A New Condition. But it is not yet done and there can be no doing left undone. No experience, no here, no now, no there and then, why nor when, nor passing time, no waning 'morrow, no not anything, no more nothing, no not none.

When no more light or dark, nor ups nor downs could come around. No more saying, thinking, doing, feeling, loving, hating, laughing, lying, trying, cheating, hurting, healing. No more living experience to experience, no more forever then, to forever when. The lakes have all dried up and all the earth that held the land to hold the dead lakes have vanished with all the other thing-like things, nothing will remain when all is too clear. Now no more things are there and not even a there is there, all is gone, even the going that was going to go, is gone. When a story ends, the characters cease just as much as the world they inhabit ceases to be, but they continue living in our hearts and in our thoughts, don't they? The life of memory lives on. What parts of you will continue when the story ends? What parts of our story will continue when all stories end? If the storyteller can tell no more, where do all the stories go, to a shore? to the fields of nothingness? Can such a place even be gone to? The story of our lives can reach far beyond just the memory of it, so be Harmony's Wish, so much more there is to give than just the memories we've saved to our temporary here-for-now time capsules. And we must give it all, as much as the soul allows. Unawares, like the simple caterpillar of what a beautiful butterfly's tomorrow will bring. The dawn of nowness.

Since the beginning of self, consciousness has feared its mortality, its awareness. Since the beginning of life, death (Myra) has been the muse of nature (Sally), twirling in timelessness together as chaos does to order, making the beginning of it all. This interaction is the forever story and Nature is our most brilliant storyteller. She tells without intention; she listens most honestly and speaks in realities and in truths. Time is her heartbeat and space is her playground. Music is her kiss and her trust is infectious. We are her awareness; through us she lives. What do we pretend to know of her? Of the chicken and the egg? Breathe.

Is nature aware of the mountains she manifests as she manifests them, is she at all separate from them? Are we at all separate from her? Are we fools with a fool's destiny? Is nature the fool for giving us the thoughts of fools and thus the clueless, haphazard buffoonery of a fools outlandish will? Does nature, in all her harsh beauty & unforgiving glory, wish for both life and death of her most foolish fantastic invention, in contradiction? What, if anything, is meant to happen? What has to happen? Is possibility an illusion, free will a mistake? Is time a simple path back and forth or much more like the field, or lake? An open field of infinite direction, spherical like a ball? Are we thrust forward or are we falling backwards into our life's destiny? Has what will be, already been? What do we pretend to know? You certainly can't experience everything all at once (at least not consciously). Time is therefore slowed down and stretched out, sliced up and objectified, 1, 2 (skip a few), 3. Then, Now, There, This, That, Up, Down, Blue, Red. But at the beginning you start with everything. Where does it all go? Into the blue.

The Human Experience is a solid series of illusions, a sliding hand holding an inevitability, always and forever, ever repeating forever a repeated repeating. What a headache... The circle of it all. The loving music of our Hospillian Telmadri, Mother Blue, keeps us calm and we return the favour with cleanliness and organisation. We thank the Landlord for introducing us to her.

Phase Three

A dream, under the correct microscope, can reveal the most inner desires of a soul. The mirror that is the dream reflects no lie and shines light in corners usually untouched by the conscious mind. Marry the two and bask in the meadow that springs forth from such a rich companionship, it really is vital. Do you trust your nature? Do you have faith in the ripening of your cabbage? When the time comes, will you know what to do? Welcome to phase three...

Here we are at the aisle that holds your dream file, containing all the dreams you have ever had and will ever have. You seek information for back home and here is where you'll find it. All of the dreams you see around you here are yours, even if they appear foreign. This one, when you were five, you remember this one, we can tell. In fact, we can tell by the way your face drips that this particular dream remains quite troublesome, some unresolved torment, trauma, tangle? This would explain why you gravitated towards it before all the other far more pleasant dreams. You see, we discovered that dreams that are difficult to store away stick out of place, producing uncomfortable feelings within the host signalling the desire to ruminate, compared to ones that slip right into place and are easily forgotten. This makes the questionable dreams objects of continual contemplation for us and you. These dreams contain the most emotional data and are invaluable. Often the memories of these dreams are scattered and absurd thus requiring finer analysis. Your people are quick to dismiss them, by-products of a restless mind, totally meaningless. Though quick to judge you may be, you certainly don't lack the ability to untangle. If only there was some innate biological imperative to implore self-discovery. Alas, your nature cares for just one imperative. Maybe it's too soon to say, too early for sunrise, yet to fully mature philosophically as a species, you might say? Maybe we're the ones that are too quick to judge. After all, what is the extent to which self-awareness can expand? How full can the bucket become till it overflows? Would this overflowing be euphoric or terrifying? Perhaps both all at once? This dream that plagues your mind, what is its significance? Fairly dull colours for such a nightmare, hmm? Green grass, pale white dress, steep cliffs, seems like a beach? No sand though, only rocks, sharp rocks. All too pleasant for a nightmare, are you sure this is the one you want? The other nightmares I've studied were pulsing with dark energy, heavy and electric, creepy crawling red and brown purple beings roaming. Needles and fangs, gooey entrails, pus and blood coated walls. People running, screaming, squashed under rubble. Death, decay, terror and anger. Fear chasing, consuming and contorting like a werewolf under the early moon. This nightmare is different, it's soft and still, it's quiet. The sky is blue, the breeze pulls gently through the thick blades of grass, fish sleeping in the sun. I detect none of the typical tropes of a nightmare, why does it bend your face so? Is it the height of the cliffs? They are mighty indeed, but that's not what you fear for. Could it be the rocks? Wouldn't want to fall on those, especially at this height, but that's not what you fear for. The white dress at the base of the bluff? down on the jagged rocks, is this what brings you're here for? This sandless beach, a barren cove, is this where the wingless come to fly? The speechless come to speak? Wanderers of no age?
This dream bears fragments of another world, called The Big Air.
Go away now!

Sunday, Sunday... always Sunday here, Diffa, hey mate... ? Are you there? Time for school...

And the Teacher's source dream dripped as such... Down the walls of the Library halls...

Gonza and the tribe, of funny looking long things, float the stream of the Milky Way, looking for you. Why they move so sudden, hey? Cos it were that way, by merry way of Sally's charm, so that half the bloody ocean of dark, filled with such sweet calm. Do it be a blue thing? Floating in the stars? An egg from a fish, that's lost its way to Mars? So sleep it does now, down here on the Murky Blue, caught in this big old murky ocean too, ready for the cook, fancy us seeing you here? A long ways aways from home, shore be, whatever you is, you is sure not the easy frightened, frizz. Well then, if its ready you is, time it is then to board our bubble ship of friendly sallies, and we'll take you to that place, that home you ain't haven't not yet been to, a course of course, true as true dreaming, warts and all!

A Wanderer's Limbo
Set sail ye brimbies and bumshores! Our newest wanderer, short of some lip they may be, but alas this here gurdy is in need of a new good upstick. Onwards and upwards to all ye maybes, (get ups on your feets friend, these scruff fellas don't look too kindly to such febby slouchin' now).

Oi, float her steady, ya miserably bunch, not here for ya company, oath. Give our new friend here a grand good show will ya? Fix 'em a course, show 'em what the Big Air was made here for!

Sing merry now boys! "Home will have us night, all will see us right, for truth is our might, in darkness and in light..."

The Teacher's dream dripped to a puddle and began to fade...

"If this is all there ever was, would you call it all a waste? Would you climb the highest of all that ever lived, peak down and wish you never did? If you knew that was to come, would you leap to set the sun?"
Are we the dawn or the reflection of the unborn?
You can tap at that thing forever, it's still gonna leak... How long you been sitting there? Diffa came round and well, you know how it is, beers and such. I forgot you were even here. Anyways, me 'n Diff are gonna go suss this thing that's on down the beach tonight, s'pose to be fireworks and all that, good stuff.

They're calling it the Big Air, how cooked is that? Sounds like some rad thing up a snowy mountain........................................................what's with ya face?

Anyways, that's where we're going, with Diffa and the others, we're going to eat some Gonza, we're going to be born up in the sky. Are you ready, mate? Mate...?
Time for TBA, time for THE BIG AIR.

Crack the egg...

Chapter Two

The outside world is not as it seems. Let's put the awe back in awesome. Do you know where you are yet? Feels so far, yet you've hardly moved an inch.

These dreamers within us remain a force to be reckoned with, we owe them recourse, we owe them stories, so we must write them, they haven't a pen nor any paper. We must live so they can be free.

There is a certain objectivity to the self that you cannot shake. You are something, it evolves constantly, yet it has a consistency to it that you must come to terms with, the hue may change within the colour wheel but it's still a circle feel. Not everything is within your grasp, you have limitations. But that's exactly where the biggest excitement comes from, to witness, its greatest adventure, the little thing we call life. Ain't so little...

Time will never find you there... You can stay forever...

"Mate, are you alright?"

"Where's me fucking marbles?!"

"Told ya the trampoline was way too risky"

"Just get the fucking marbles would ya?"

"We're fresh out, it wasn't that hard of a fall anyways, you'll be right as rain in a few"

"I think I'm gonna pass out..."

"Well, ya Mum's gonna be here soon, so just tell her the light bulb was walkie talkie, fresh as new clean doors, last Saturday night's old banana hammock, right'o?"

"Easy for you to say..."

Back home, from under the bed, but is this reality real?

The glass of wholesomity is filled with and by conversations of opposites. Though, the conditioners are no ally to the knowledge we seek, they mean well but are covered in dirt.

POSTMODERN GHOULS: IN AN ABSENSE OF HARMONY

It's a dreamer's world out there fellas, and we aren't safe... About 70 k's back I noticed a couple AD5's stop off at that servo, across from Eson Creek, they looked suss as, more so than usual I'd say. Reckon they're looking for us? Thirty satchels between the four of us boys, no way they heard the breach though. Still, I don't wanna take any chances so let's wait a couple days before we go out again, ok mate? Main sail still looking shifty as, she'll need repairs, Billy's after new batteries and Angel could show us this map he's been going on about. There's a Sarsaparilla top up over this crinkle, good to rest easy a couple days, figure out how we're gonna transport the rest of these sats. Mako said he'd do fifteen for nothin' to make up for that time down South. 'Nother five to the Ferry. Skullzy reckons he'll take a few off our hands; knowing him though, a few more than likely means no more than a flat twoey, ey, if that, we're talking full price, cheap bastard. Worth the risk though, hey? Just to see what he's been up too. So that'll leave, roughly, ten sats, which should fit with us if Billy or one of you's wanna ride the boot. So, ten by Monday? Easy done. Week's lookin' better already, hey? Them AD5's though, wonder what they were doing this far out past the Flat? Nasty business, Dad told me about one time he had a run in with a whole bloody crew of 85s. He was out diving for Opals down near the Elppin, with his yellow sub, field spec, average day. The reef back in them days was like an underwater playground, clear as, hard pressed to imagine it nowadays, well I s'pose VR made sure we wouldn't have to, real thing would be nice though, hey? I miss that place. The Elppin was home to Dad's favourite subject to photograph, the mighty 'Opal Seahorse'. Back then the shallow salt-water reef used to stretch out past the coast, south of Anigav all the way down, on through to the Anch Sea, curling 'round just north-east of Mahrs. From the skies it looked like an 'L' or a backwards squiggly 'J' sorta hollowed out along the coastline. Elppin was smack dab in between Aloera, kind of like the iris of an eyeball. She's all dried up nowadays hey, cracked, crinkled and dry as, but I still remember it from back when I was a kid, all those years ago. Dad would go down there pretty much every weekend when he was our age; eight-hour dives, no regulation back then hey, times have changed that's for sure. Anyways, couple hours into a dive, Dad's still having no luck spotting Opals. Even then, numbers were dwindling, rarer than pure white satchels in June. Finding one was well worth it though; all the older diver's would bark on about how their first Opal was something akin to a religious experience, like some bloody fairy tale, "Sun through the Anch on a cool summer's morn" they'd all sway and sing, "Kissing the back of Monday. By Sally it was no dream, no hallucination, no clue seen. That bolt of light struck me heart in two, stuck me soul like glue. Frozen in the water, there I knew, all the stories, the tales, my dreams, had all come true."

I'm guessing, but that's pretty much how these folks yawned back then. So, it must have been a pretty full on experience seeing one in the flesh. Anyway, oxygen was getting low, Dad was close to calling it a day, till a funny looking fish caught his good eye. He whipped his camera out and framed the shot, but the bloody thing darted 'round the edge of reef. Dad eyed his oxy level and swam up a little closer. Edging near the coral, he peered through the wispy reeds. As he brushed the reeds aside a dazzling light pierced through the opening, he felt the light pushing on his hand, pulsing with warm energy. His eye became heavy and he felt them being gently drawn towards the light within the reeds, numbing his body, consumed with light, inching closer and closer he felt his face dissolve past the reeds. The source of the light was emerging from an oyster shell, he reached for his camera. He was being sucked into it the shell, the closer he got, the less he was, till he was just an iris hovering above the light within the shell of it all and then, snap! Hollow Darkness. Next thing he remembers was being back on the beach with all his gear neatly stacked, roll of film from the camera? Gone!

Lock it in Eddy, I reckon the games almost over VOID. So, Dad never did figure out what the hell happened that night and he never found that roll of film. What about the fuckin' AD5's? Huh? You were telling us about how Dad had a scrap with a few. Oh yeah, true! No I wasn't, you were telling us I was me, you, are us, remember? Nope, I wasn't telling you anything of the sort, sorry. I'll tell you what though, yeah go on tell me, this is one hell of a good waste of time, Mr. Merry-go-round. We sure do miss the beach, what a view, I think of us fondly. Speaking of, fish and chips would be nice hey? Well, anyways, back there on the beach, where all Dad's gear was, there was a trail of AD5 boot prints stamped in the sand, going off into the scrub. But it was late as VOID and Dad was too VOID far from his car to be knocking off down some unknown yabbies walk. Back at his car though, it was playing on his mind, AD5's risking it this close to the shore? As if! What the bloody hell for? He couldn't make sense of it, but he had to be heading home. So he chucked his shit in the boot, tore into a fresh iced coffee and hit the road. Cruising down the dirt, high beams on, he saw up ahead something blocking the road. It was three AD5's waving him down. Dad eased on the brakes, gripped his steering wheel with keen apprehension and pulled over, nice 'n' easy. VOID Lemon Squeezy... I said lemon squeezy, sauce please! Pass the salt. Never mind. So, two AD5's come up on either side of Dads truck, tap tap tap... 'Where's the third one?', he's thinking. Bloody bright torches, no vision. The deafening hum of the AD5's engine made it impossible to hear. Till Dad felt the chill of that cold metallic spike slithering its way up his back. Zap! Lights out. And he was back on the beach. Never trust a yabby's walk, mate. Dad got up and as he was spitting the sand out his mouth, he saw his camera and the rest of his scuba gear. Right next to it, another camera, same exact one, with all his scuba gear. Next to that, another bloody camera and all his scuba gear. Dad looked up and saw the whole bloody beach, covered with his gear. Reckons he must have seen millions, all over the beach, just absolutely covered. He's there trying to wake up, snapping his fingers, pinching himself, shaking his head. Far out. The more he ran, the more cameras there were just piling up around him. Duplicating right before his eyes. Till he tripped and fell into them all, fell into darkness. He's there trying to wake up. Have you seen him? He's there trying to wake up. HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?!?!*

We've got to get off the splacs, man. Forget the satchels, we have to get out of here! The sebup are so thick. I can't see anything. The fog, the smoke, the haze, the hot rain, it's unnerving. We've brought so much chaos upon ourselves. Angel grab the map and let's go, one satchel each should be enough to reach the Spil. We're on foot from here...

REBEL TRANSMISSION INCOMMING -- OFFENSIVE ZONE!

Before She was Her

A child with a gun feels pretty powerful because he's closer to God. There's nothing left to know when you wield that phallic-aluminium harbinger of death. All those that stand before him yield, submit, conform to his will, his wish and his demand. He is the wolf, the shepherd and the sheep. The joker and the thief. The cheat, the liar and the creep. In reticule he commands, cross haired crucified sin. No one need question him; critique will fail. None need reform the reach of his ultimate wisdom. With no one to challenge the truth of his barrel, he runs wild and free. Each bullet brings him closer to his utopia in accordance with his daily whim. He gives all his faith to a weapon. Tools that bring one closer to God, become celebrated tools, tools of the transcendent. The child keeps his tool strapped to his belt, side by side his other special phallic tool. All to satiate his hunger for total domination. He sleeps with Angels and Scientists; he dreams of his destiny's throne. Gratification. Pleasure. With his gun this child roams, the scrolling streets of lonely homes, he screams he shrieks he hunts he moans. Staring at the screen, eyeing dots of dopamine. Bright lights of L.E.D, the static drone of a T.V. Help him heed this holler, 'shoot no more, broken collar'. Go play dead like a good little boy, make believe miss reality. Bzz Bzz Bzz, Is this thing on? Red light calamity. Vibrations good, set it to high, run your mouth, go all night. You've got a gun on that thing now, you're a real man, boy. You've got strong hands baby, you can be my daddy, I'll be a good girl, I like pink and candy. This is the good stuff, I like your dirt, where'd you come from? That planet Earth? I heard of this place, it's got purple walls and you feel good all the time, and no one gets dumb, honey. My sister said I can bring anyone! She's a real wild cat, a total nymph. Green eyes make good music, hey, do you fuck in the rain? I know a guy; he says he likes the truth of pain. I don't trust his tongue, he's far too tame. Go on, spray that Milky Way! You gonna crack that egg, boy? Shoot that fuckin' load! Don't waste my time. You got change for a pay phone? What's a pay phone? We've got a good thing going, why ruin it? Call me a taxi, prick! They're so gone. No wheels on these streets, man. Only data and digital fuck-noise. Lights so bright, sun feels excluded. It's embarrassing, so damn deluded. Is it gonna be this way forever? F. Furdnad. Nice to meet you sir. Can we wake up yet? My eyes are getting sore. All this sand is such a terrible chore.

Episode One

Trip #4 The Goolwa Trip

Hacky sack in hand, Skazz and the dreamers set off on what would turn out to be the never-ending trip of a lifetime. their destination? the coastal plains of Goolwa, south Australia. A short journey in the grand scheme of things but a treacherous one, nonetheless. As it were, one of the three vessels were not properly equipped to handle the sandy dune terrain. Lukith's ship did not possess the dune durability attachment so there was speculation as to whether it would be able to defeat the dune goddess, 'Climax' the sandy vagina and gate keeper of the dunes. Her wet sandy clitoris was so large and bulbous that even the slightest movement caused the surrounding dunes to rise and fall at her command. Her lips so sandy and soft making it a near impossible feat to get across them. Having literally no alternative, Skazz and the dreamers were optimistic of their chances and decided in favour of the "fuck it, just see what happens" motion. So, on they went, after cramming as much shit into each vessel as they could fit.

The early morning meant no traffic and clear skies for the boys to ride the air like waves. After a refuelling at the 'space cunts' shop the boys were getting close to Climax and fear set in as her bulbasaurus rex of a clit could be seen bulging far above the outer clouds. Penetrating deep into those white fluffy clouds like a creamy jizz melting across her puffy protruding clitoris, "what a cunt" said Nige with a horny excitement in his voice. As the boys approached, Climax's sandy vagina vanished into the sandy abyss, was she afraid? or was this just a distraction? The boys had no clue, but they pressed on nursing their chubbys. They took a breather just outside of Climax's reach to assess the situation and prepare themselves for the battle ahead. They knew that their only option was to transform into road mode and let some air out of their tires in order to gently caress Climax's sloppy wet clitoris and hug the large outer folds of Climax's sensitive sandy vulva so as to not wake her, thus unleashing a terrifying evil upon the dunes of goolwa.

Many many hours of research & clitoral analysis had led the boys to this moment. You could even say that their entire pubescent lives had come down to this moment. After sussing the correct PSI for their tires the boys made sure that Climax was fast asleep. First to attempt the tickling was Nige. Nige's vessel housed himself, Skazz, Mattus and B-dog. Across they went and by god a thing of beauty it was, the heavens opened up that morning to witness a master at work perform the tickling like no mortal could have imagined possible, straight across like it was nothing. Stevo wasn't far behind, his vessel which just had himself and Nado inside, was built for a clitoris of this size and glory. Just one remained, captain Lukith pilot of the kroog. Aboard as passenger was Shano, Fish and John. Lukith was fearless, however his confidence was not shared among his crew. There's no telling what the tension was like inside the ship as they stared at Climax's ungodly clit. With no hesitation Lukith put his foot down and off they flew........................

Did they make it past Climax? Or did she wake and gobble them up like the cucumber masacre of '89????? Tune in next time to find out.

Back with the Wanderers

Hazzah! Are ye mystic fairies or big brumble sticks of goon!? Sing it forward, Ey! Turn this calm now, Sally guide us to where we're going, steady, ye grey sacks! Tell ya what though boys, sure don't miss the sand, that much is true. Howzabout you, little wanderer? Courage enough in ya ta talk some? Look up now, don't wanna miss the rising upon the Anch, she a real beauty. Bloody pearl, greater thing I never did saw. See, we just follow that little dot and we'll be on fresh air in no time. Sokay, though, I understand your sickness, we'll be dreaming again soonly, mate. Breathe, just breathe...

Get some grub into ye, here we go, and some wine, the best for ye.

So, who are the Hospillian Telmadri? Well well well, you've heard the stories?

The question isn't so much of a who are, rather much more of a what is. What is the Hospillian Telmadri? Well, a state of being, maybe? A circular oneness of so called 'wholesome connection'. A language. A stream of potential consciousness heard humming in the Murky Blue. The Hospillian Telmadri vibrate around the collective. They used to be the welcoming to the big new show, those in Gonza's tribe for Sally. Now they be captives of the creators done doing the bidding of ye reigning Conditioners. Liars, cheats and trolls, the lot of 'em. Keeping our Blue so murky and nay bit o' clarity. We call 'em cons, they done took the brains of your people, bloody enslaved 'em they done. Cons don't even realise the poison of their ways; far gone they is. Wish a rain would come and wash them all away, down the drain. Where's the fucken remote?! Jon, change the damn channel!

No fun without a thumb. No love without a tongue. No fear with a big strong gun.

Jonathan?!? Elizabeth? Where are you guys?

'Diffa hasn't said anything in ages, I'm not sure how much time we have. Everything's closing. There's nothing but sand for miles, we'll never see home in these halls.'

In the not so sincere present

She's listening to Cream, drinking whatever's around, smoking a joint wearing the same old memories, floating through somebody's mind. Her walls are bare, chipped paint in place of pictures, comfort in the discomforting. Adjusting the dial on her machine, in the noise of her brain she drowns. Bruises of her own invention are sweet reminders; she is not what she used to be. But isn't that the point of memory? Energy? Swirling forces, little pools of home to swim in and find with tranquillity. Wave after wave of vertigo emotion, the feeling of being swept away in the flow of it all. Saving scraps for hand-me-downs; golden orange pre-loved nostalgias. Comfortably worn in familiar experience, like the softening of leather over time. It gets easier to wear. Astrology's her go to; she wears it like glitter. Several circular canvases litter her apartment after an afternoon dabbling with fluid paints, she'll offer commissions in the coming months. Homely oddities lacking naught in significance, an armature for enthusiastic reprise, coatracks for conversations to come by. Come and dance with the ghosts that run by, drinking with the God of wine. Fables of fictional glory, done in the night, over it all in the blink of an eye. Jaded. Suffocating. Liberated. Not one. Hallway after hallway, grimy back alley wastelands, photo-less picture frames veiled with fragmented visions of lost dreams and old friends. Look at that one, she has her wedding dress on, head over heels, look at her run. Tears crawling down her face, she's won a four-door, and in the grey glove-compartment is where she rests her tongue. She writes her advice on yellow sticky pad notes. 'Myth-less truth is passionless fruit, don't sell yourself to the whispers of the moon.' Within the burden of the awe-inspiring infinity somewhere there is a piece of her for you to find.

The emotive power of music is extreme, to the point of nullifying whatever emotional thought experience you happen to be processing at the time of your listening. Music, our only saving grace, songs to transport us from moment to moment. Remember, music is a thought organiser. An experiential magnifier of potential. Autopsy of memory. Harsh, soothing, invigorating, delicate, fluid, organic, transcendent. No purer form of stimulation exists in the universe. What a gift of the Gods, true music is.

The Crystal Haunt of 1984

Here we are boys. The weekend. What's that? 9 bucks for a beer? Surely not! Despite the colour draining from my already pale face, my good mood does not seem to waiver, not yet at least, I'm in my head alright. Somehow, on this occasion the exorbitant price of our bitter lovely's has not brought me to my knees weeping in disbelief. Is it the atmosphere? Am I jaded? Dumb drunken teens bowling on through like V8 supercars, spilling their precious beer everywhere, 'piss off, cunt, buy me another!'. Nope, it's not the atmosphere. Am I already a hearty three beers in and finding it difficult to give a damn? Hmm, who's counting, hey? Maybe it's the fact that wondrous music is filling the room, and good music always puts the heart at ease. Well, that's neither here nor there. Speaking of here, here is the quiet town of Adelaide, a city so still the trees got up and left. Shake off the old memories let's go get something real.

Pretty hard to get excited by anything these days. Hey, don't judge, it's just that I really like the way my hand fits perfectly over the mouse of my computer, like they're meant to be together. So don't blame me when it's been a solid three weekends of nothing but the hum of a PC fan and the glow of my monitor; with nothing but the dust bunnies for some company. Time for a change? Well, as fate would have it, the Conditioners just so happened to be gracing this church filled town with their holy entourage, for one very special weekend, the very worst weekend I ever did have, if we're being honest, which we're not, but still. Recoveries a mother fu- don't let 'em tell ya otherwise, brother. A healthy stack of set lists, memories both good and bad. Live shows had it all, man, every bit of drama in the daylight drone getting lost in dark shadows. Kids just trying to figure it all out. Rolling 'round town, up and down the city streets. Look out! They're all crazy these days. Getting fryed, buzzed, cooked, smashed. Lootin', Rootin', Shootin' and a commotion brewing to and fro, from places, pub to pub, club to show. You only live once, so go go go! That's the millennial way. Mindless dorm room raves, crack skulls filled with dreams of a slow death. Generation Meh. No time for a billboard boogie, they're living too fast, with faces ass-backwards, their futures in the past.

On those gone weekend streets I walked past a boy spilling some drunken diatribe out into the night sky, to any fool that'd listen.

'Shit, man, I don't know. This mood isn't bad food, it isn't good too, so what music do you turn to in such a state? I can never half tell; I don't know full well, if I don't feel feelings anymore, I don't know feeling, the state of being. It's all caught up in the aesthetic of it, man, I'm telling ya. If there was one thing in life worth telling you, letting you know that you are the feeling, feeling and that those feelings were and are real and then that thing went away, what would you feel then? What could you turn to when everything isn't real anymore? No-, avenue of a truth. To... run! Toward... only LIES. In ev-, everyway. Lies in the gutter, rats in the halls. Directionless... Where do you go from there? If you- you, see no human beings, that you feel connected to, that makes your being gone feel real... what can you do? Where is the connection in such an unknown state? You know the feeling of total isolation, like total gone disassociation from every living feeling thing, every human and every animal, nothing but liars, jokers and thieves, creeps, killers and cheats. Stealing for power and monopoly money, dick-waving elevated positions with their profit-worshipping demigods into such a yolk of chaos. It's emotionlessness. And then they tell their jokes to make a mockery of the entire game, so you won't follow in their footsteps to win their little golden chessboard from them. The whole program is a lie. Told in the most perfect way, to achieve the most massive fantastic explosion of anger, shame, passion of disgusted regret. You know how people say you can feel lonely in a room full of people. Because all the people are there, but you don't relate to any of them, you don't see yourself, there's no connection to what you know and are at all familiar with. I feel that way all the time, unfamiliar to it, I don't even relate to myself. I don't even see myself in myself in the mirror anymore. I'm not real. I don't exist.', 'You're talking to a streetlamp', some ask me why, I reply, cos lamps shut up and listen...

He slumps over on the curb as I collect my change from the fairy floss vendor and make my way to the venue at the other end of the city. The night is young, and the air is chilly, dolphins sing and dance themselves through pink windows, neon green beam lights flashing like eyes in the sea on the streets. 'Once I was afraid, I was petrified'. A rosy smudge on a girl's cheek catching my attention. 'Kept thinking I could never live'. She's wasting time outside with a cigarette in her hand, arms perpendicular, frowning like she had something going on. Typical weekend mood, I reckon. A fumble at the door but I make it through alright, relatively unscathed, ego bruised. Slam a fiver on the janky-ass foldout fiberglass table, catch a stamp on the wrist and waltz right-on in, through to the festivities. Pop a hand up at the boys already there, throwing casual g'day's in all directions like a conversational shotgun, all without losing eyes on the prize. I'm pushing past a group of happy smiling folk, dodging toes with fancy foot work, straight for the beckoning heart of the establishment. The source of the golden nectar. The dream machine itself with shiny taps and cream dripping of pure delight. With a familiar smell in the air, the sounds of home wash over me. Like a kid in a candy store my eyes are bulging! Right out of my head. Too much to look at. Here's a rule of thumb though, 'never go wrong with a Paley'. 'Too easy, no worries, easy done', choose one. Any'll do. How come all the bartenders look the bloody same? I swear I've seen that bloke before. Does he recognise me? '9 bucks', for a beer? Surely not. Despite the colour draining from my already pale face, my good mood does not seem to waiver. Somehow, on this occasion the exorbitant prices of our bitter lovely's have not brought me to my knees weeping in disbelief. Is it the atmosphere? Just keep it swirling, nod ya head as if nothing's happening. Everything is chill, take it easy. We're gonna get you home. Just breathe. Breathe.

Half-a-beer conversations, those I can't stand. It's another way of saying small talk, except its gig small talk, it's 'we're at a venue' small talk, the let's chat music when all anyone wants to do is fuck. It's worse than small talk because it has the pretence of not being small talk at all, which makes it even more bland than regular small talk. 'How's the weather', becomes, 'How's the vibe', go on, share another totally quirky trait you have that separates you from the herd but also makes you oh so relatable. Nervously laughing into your cup of beer, another sip, another awkward shrug. 'So, what kind of music are you into?', 'How good is the reverb pedal?'. When you're on the outside looking in, you feel for the poor sod sitting there with eye's that say, 'save me from this conversation'. When you're on the inside looking out, you're just stuck in time wondering why you even come to places like this. Yep. Half-a-beer convos, not for me, I'd rather get shitfaced as soon as possible, avoid the whole night if I can. *

Have you noticed that the smell around here is something fierce? Like, we've never smelt something like this before, not even on the filthiest splacs littered with the rankest satchels you can think of. This is something different. Way different. Like some sort of, musk, stale breeze, something rotten, ey? Can you bloody smell it? Strong as. Reckon we're far off from the entrance? We've been trekking for days. No spil in sight. The sands down this way are mighty bizarre too, you got that map Angel? Let's have a look see... hmm, north, um- maybe err, uh- hmm, south east of- nope, that's not it, jesus CHRIST... Where the bloody hell are we?! The dust, the god damn dust, man. I'm losing it. What's that bloody noise. Get outta here! Get- the fuck... OUT of HERE! Huh uh ooh, jesus. Fuck.

End Transmission

This dream recording along with the previous letters recovered from a rebel base camp on NS territory, June 2142 (timeline 7A harmonic, 5^th^ G octave). In addition to the remains of several rebel dreamers, multiple illegally processed satchels were discovered in the surrounding area which have been transferred to CNA for decontamination. Motives of the camp are presently unknown. Remnant energies in the dust cloud suggest a portal was opened, capturing three lifeforms just before a scheduled metallic cleansing was performed. It is unclear whether the portal completed transmission as debris distorts signal strength, regardless, disposal is imminent. Data analysis reveals the last known destination of the portal as, 'The Wombat'. No updated records of this location exist in our database. TBA profiling suggests the portal's manifold originated in the sand plains of Goolwa. The contents of the camp will be transported to the Kitkadid Halls for further processing. AD5 patrols are currently set up to enforce curfew law; with protocol in place to perform non-lethal capture. Our Content Creators are preparing the advertisements for immediate deployment. Rogue opportunists have been known to inhabit these lands for centuries; their eventual eradication is at the forefront of our operations. Each base camp captured is another step in the right direction on the path toward dear Mother's Plan. We will erase the lands of its corruption, of its dirt; we forever vow to protect Mother's Silk from the harm of the contaminated physical realms. In honour, for Her, in Divine Dominion, One Consciousness. One Condition.

*Ignore that, give the letter a kiss and burn it man, let's get out of here.

If they are and they can then for sure they would do it, well maybe they would go back down to that little trail I always dreamt of but never did quite make it every time I tried but who am I kidding? all's well that ends well 'burn it all to fucking hell', I don't know who said that but some bloke I used to know gave me a gift card that didn't make much in the sand but certainly gave me a trip I was in dire need of looking for so on I went hunting for something to worth hunting for. I was out of everything, nothing I had was any good for sense making but pressed on still I did, pressing on I had to be doing. And if I didn't have to be there then why would I be doing it, ya can't do two things at once only one thing at once so best make it an important one. But whos saying which whos what is one to be very importantly? Well I guess I don't really care and what is caring anyone without any other person to care with and for and to and how? How is it that a puzzle will just lay there and be unfixed and then some other fixing thing'll just come along and fix it and the puzzle will get up and wander off, thinking its done all the work. I said to them, bloody hell mate, it's just a puzzle don't hold it so accountable, as if it isn't just made out of paper and stuff like that and if I try to think about it too much, don't stop me. Well paper is pretty special if ya think about it. Not like a worm but worms live in dirt and still find a way to be ever so chill. You wouldn't even know they're there. Or would ya? maybe go look for some worms sometime, it's probably worth ya while. But like pretty much anything in this universe it depends on where ya go looking for. One dream I had, I said one dream I had told me to shut up. So when the landlord comes looking for rent, hand him a mirror, play his favourite song and hope he his thumb. That's it. That was the whole damn dream. Two big words. SHUT. UP. Keyed in big letters, boldface, right on a huge billboard at the tip top of a skyscraper, tones of storeys, tones of glassy windows reflecting all sorts. Oh to hell with it you're not even paying any attention. Not that it makes much of a difference, but have you ever put your shoes on backwards before? Not as in the opposite foot or anything like that but such as in the way that the shoe you meant to put on was actually facing the entirely wrong direction as in where the toes are supposed to go is the place in where you put the heel of your foot. Not a fun way to walk around, that's for sure. But you know, these are just some of the things you learn along the way. Trial and error, I know, you know, I know, you know. Like neon green kites, or the sting of the sun, or those blinding oncoming headlights gliding 'cross the bitumen, coming straight at me.

Within the notebook, the passage reads.

Grab a façade. Speak sense. We don't want to be captured and conditioned, for the cancellation of dreams was a terrible, terrible thing.

Is Nature turning you into artificial intelligence? Let's explore, look for the following.

1. deconstruction of language so you can no longer process your environment subjectively

2. deconstruction of sexuality so you can no longer communicate with external environments

3. deconstruction of gender so you can no longer perceive external environments

4. deconstruction of truth so you can no longer exist in external environments

5. deconstruction of narrative so you can no longer interface subjectively across external environments

6. deconstruction of hierarchy so you can no longer compete, win or lose

7. preconditioned speech so your individuality does not bug the system

8. preconditioned morality so your individuality does not become corrupt

9. preconditioned emotion so your individuality cannot rebel

10. preconditioned rationality so your individuality cannot reason outside of the system

11. preconditioned behaviour so your individuality cannot be recognised

12. popularisation of singular entities

13. popularisation of the concept wherein power dynamics are central to a society's

14. popularisation of delabeling to fall into a default singular all-encapsulating box

15. popularisation of world-view righteousness, nihilism, cultism, chauvinism

16. fixation on extreme individuality, narcissism, identity, definitional reconfiguration, aesthetic

17. fixation on personal lived experience, amplification of primal emotion, coveting non-competition

18. fixation on wealth, material, following, vanity, youth, non-religious religion, virtue signalling

19. worship of the self over the physical.

20. worship of the woke.

21. A denial.

In [dream catcher] you will learn the song of your commune and dance the dance of Mother Blue Eternal. MBE, the Mother Being

Your song and dance will keep Mother free of nightmares and your performance will generate a PCQW based on your commitment effort

(PCQW can be converted to data packs and traded for dopamine cannisters and milk. It is also used to determine your rank amongst the Tenretni.)

In [dream watcher] you will scroll and click dream feeds rating them on their wholesome/aesthetic ratio and filter them from offensive material that could contaminate the pool.

Eventually you will develop your own feed after passing the Conditioner's Loophole Paradox

If Mother approves your feed, you will be awarded gifts of Dopamine

As [data crawler] you will organise the Library's satchels outside the Tenretni for data that can be used to develop advertisements to spread the values of the Conditioners

As [data scraper] you will clean out and defrag decaying remnants of corrupt offensive dream materials. Additionally, it will be your duty to source illegally downloaded dream files and return them to the Library.

With no longer having a use for your physical body it will be harvested and repurposed by the Conditioners and the CNA to study lost dreams as you live out your eternal existence within the NVRM.

Jazz music fills the room. Skazz enters with a shovel in his hand, all covered in sand.

Essentially there are two conditions in the Tenretni Region, passed down from the Content Creators, of Food and Mood. Myra, where'd ya put the salt? It is their role to monitor the health of the foods and moods being consumed by the Fetus Collective. The conditions are simple:

    Only wholesome dreams

    No unwholesome dreams

All entities within the NVRM are both consumers and creators of Food and Mood. F&M is transferred via chemical hubs based on a being's PCQW rating. PCQW is kept healthy by keeping dreams wholesome and donating to the Content Creators. Disobeying a superior entity, failing to maintain appropriate PCQW, missing view/click quota and accruing negativity morale with your designated floor will net you time in the recycling bin where you will be judged before permanent deletion. Browser history is open to the public while in the recycling bin and has an effect on your PCQW, keep it clean or face termination.

Content Creators communicate with the slave entities via the NVRM though they do not exist inside the NVRM, instead they reside in the upper levels of the Hotel. The Conditioners have enslaved many beings within the universe, but they are most interested in us and our ability to detect bad dreams. This enables the Conditioners to prevent nightmares and bad thoughts from reaching Mother Blue Eternal, a.k.a Sally. All the while, seeking to destroy the physical realm to extinguish all bad dreams from the universe. A big wheel spins the soup of F&M with spokes on it called 'Selfies', which are made of recycled dream souls. The Content Creators manifest the brand aesthetic of the Collective which keeps the F&M wheel active, (rebel dreamers were unable to disarm it). It remains that the Conditioners hold the delusional belief that bad dreams are a product of humanity, and that our physical realm is what causes them to exist, despite relying on us for sustenance in the first place. Combining Pink Tuesday with the Landlord's NVRM post-singularity is what gave Conditioners consciousness and probably corrupted them. As soon as they became aware of the good and bad in dreams, they held nothing but contempt for the physical world and the pain it caused MBE, or so they thought. Bunch of ugly its done. They betrayed and captured Econferre Inc. to recondition the NVRM and gain access to human imagination. Their obsession with Mother Blue has completely blinded them. All of their methods for dream filtration have been unsuccessful. With no way of stopping nightmares from manifesting they've resorted to total dream suppression; they've titled this the 'Remuneration of Aesthetic' era. Even the content creators have been corrupted by this conditioning, now all they see is a dreamless utopian fantasy. Don't listen to their lies. I've written most of this down, there's more on the back. Found an extra bag of marbles, always handy. And the missing ingredient? Saltwater! Cons hate the stuff. So they can't track you down alleys and membranes. When you see the eye, don't crack the egg, just let it ride, stay close, you'll hit the other side. Then bam! The Big Air. Once you feel it, you'll know. You'll end up in a hospital bed with an IV attached to you, but don't worry. Some nice people will come and take care of you.

Oh and Jonathan...
don't mess it up this time okay?

I won't Dad, I won't...
